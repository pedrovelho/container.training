## Exercises

- At the end of each day, there is a series of exercises

- To make the most out of the training, please try the exercises!

  (it will help to practice and memorize the content of the day)

- We recommend to take at least one hour to work on the exercises

  (if you understood the content of the day, it will be much faster)

- Each day will start with a quick review of the exercises of the previous day

## A brief introduction

- This was initially written by [J√©r√¥me Petazzoni](https://twitter.com/jpetazzo) to support in-person,
  instructor-led workshops and tutorials
  
- Credit is also due to [multiple contributors](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/graphs/contributors) ‚Äî thank you!

- You can also follow along on your own, at your own pace

- We included as much information as possible in these slides

- We recommend having a mentor to help you ...

- ... Or be comfortable spending some time reading the Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/) ...

- ... And looking for answers on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kubernetes) and other outlets

## Hands on, you shall practice

- Nobody ever became a Jedi by spending their lives reading Wookiepedia

- Likewise, it will take more than merely *reading* these slides
  to make you an expert

- These slides include *tons* of demos, exercises, and examples

- They assume that you have access to a Kubernetes cluster

- If you are attending a workshop or tutorial:
  <br/>you will be given specific instructions to access your cluster

- If you are doing this on your own:
  <br/>the first chapter will give you various options to get your own cluster

# Pre-requirements

- Be comfortable with the UNIX command line

  - navigating directories

  - editing files

  - a little bit of bash-fu (environment variables, loops)

- Some Docker knowledge

  - `docker run`, `docker ps`, `docker build`

  - ideally, you know how to write a Dockerfile and build it
    <br/>
    (even if it's a `FROM` line and a couple of `RUN` commands)

- It's totally OK if you are not a Docker expert!

## Hands-on sections

- The whole workshop is hands-on

- We are going to build, ship, and run containers!

- You are invited to reproduce all the demos

- All hands-on sections are clearly identified, like the gray rectangle below

.lab[

- This is the stuff you're supposed to do!

- Go to  to view these slides

## You get a cluster of cloud VMs

- Each person gets a private cluster of cloud VMs (not shared with anybody else)

- They'll remain up for the duration of the workshop

- You should have a little card with login+password+IP addresses

- You can automatically SSH from one VM to another

- The nodes have aliases: `node1`, `node2`, etc.

## Why don't we run containers locally?

- Installing this stuff can be hard on some machines

  (32 bits CPU or OS... Laptops without administrator access... etc.)

- *"The whole team downloaded all these container images from the WiFi!
  <br/>... and it went great!"* (Literally no-one ever)

- All you need is a computer (or even a phone or tablet!), with:

  - an Internet connection

  - a web browser

  - an SSH client

.debug[[shared/prereqs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/prereqs.md)]
---

class: in-person

## SSH clients

- On Linux, OS X, FreeBSD... you are probably all set

- On Windows, get one of these:

  - [putty](http://www.putty.org/)
  - Microsoft [Win32 OpenSSH](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Install-Win32-OpenSSH)
  - [Git BASH](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
  - [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)

- On Android, [JuiceSSH](https://juicessh.com/)
  ([Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonelli.juicessh))
  works pretty well

- Nice-to-have: [Mosh](https://mosh.org/) instead of SSH, if your Internet connection tends to lose packets

.debug[[shared/prereqs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/prereqs.md)]
---

class: in-person, extra-details

## What is this Mosh thing?

*You don't have to use Mosh or even know about it to follow along.
<br/>
We're just telling you about it because some of us think it's cool!*

- Mosh is "the mobile shell"

- It is essentially SSH over UDP, with roaming features

- It retransmits packets quickly, so it works great even on lossy connections

  (Like hotel or conference WiFi)

- It has intelligent local echo, so it works great even in high-latency connections

  (Like hotel or conference WiFi)

- It supports transparent roaming when your client IP address changes

  (Like when you hop from hotel to conference WiFi)

.debug[[shared/prereqs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/prereqs.md)]
---

class: in-person, extra-details

## Using Mosh

- To install it: `(apt|yum|brew) install mosh`

- It has been pre-installed on the VMs that we are using

- To connect to a remote machine: `mosh user@host`

  (It is going to establish an SSH connection, then hand off to UDP)

- It requires UDP ports to be open

  (By default, it uses a UDP port between 60000 and 61000)

.debug[[shared/prereqs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/prereqs.md)]
---
class: in-person

## Connecting to our lab environment

.lab[

- Log into the first VM (`node1`) with your SSH client:
  ```bash
  ssh `user`@`A.B.C.D`
  ```

  (Replace `user` and `A.B.C.D` with the user and IP address provided to you)

<!--
```bash
for N in $(awk '/\Wnode/{print $2}' /etc/hosts); do
  ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no $N true
done
```

```bash
### FIXME find a way to reset the cluster, maybe?
```
-->

]

You should see a prompt looking like this:
```
[A.B.C.D] (...) user@node1 ~
$
```
If anything goes wrong ‚Äî ask for help!

.debug[[shared/connecting.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/connecting.md)]
---

class: in-person

## `tailhist`

- The shell history of the instructor is available online in real time

- Note the IP address of the instructor's virtual machine (A.B.C.D)

- Open http://A.B.C.D:1088 in your browser and you should see the history

- The history is updated in real time

  (using a WebSocket connection)

- It should be green when the WebSocket is connected

  (if it turns red, reloading the page should fix it)

.debug[[shared/connecting.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/connecting.md)]
---

## Doing or re-doing the workshop on your own?

- Use something like
  [Play-With-Docker](http://play-with-docker.com/) or
  [Play-With-Kubernetes](https://training.play-with-kubernetes.com/)

  Zero setup effort; but environment are short-lived and
  might have limited resources

- Create your own cluster (local or cloud VMs)

  Small setup effort; small cost; flexible environments

- Create a bunch of clusters for you and your friends
    ([instructions](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/tree/master/prepare-vms))

  Bigger setup effort; ideal for group training

.debug[[shared/connecting.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/connecting.md)]
---

## For a consistent Kubernetes experience ...

- If you are using your own Kubernetes cluster, you can use [jpetazzo/shpod](https://github.com/jpetazzo/shpod)

- `shpod` provides a shell running in a pod on your own cluster

- It comes with many tools pre-installed (helm, stern...)

- These tools are used in many demos and exercises in these slides

- `shpod` also gives you completion and a fancy prompt

- It can also be used as an SSH server if needed

.debug[[shared/connecting.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/connecting.md)]
---

class: self-paced

## Get your own Docker nodes

- If you already have some Docker nodes: great!

- If not: let's get some thanks to Play-With-Docker

.lab[

- Go to http://www.play-with-docker.com/

- Log in

- Create your first node

<!-- ```open http://www.play-with-docker.com/``` -->

]

You will need a Docker ID to use Play-With-Docker.

(Creating a Docker ID is free.)

.debug[[shared/connecting.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/connecting.md)]
---

## We will (mostly) interact with node1 only

*These remarks apply only when using multiple nodes, of course.*

- Unless instructed, **all commands must be run from the first VM, `node1`**

- We will only check out/copy the code on `node1`

- During normal operations, we do not need access to the other nodes

- If we had to troubleshoot issues, we would use a combination of:

  - SSH (to access system logs, daemon status...)

  - Docker API (to check running containers and container engine status)

.debug[[shared/connecting.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/connecting.md)]
---

## Terminals

Once in a while, the instructions will say:
<br/>"Open a new terminal."

There are multiple ways to do this:

- create a new window or tab on your machine, and SSH into the VM;

- use screen or tmux on the VM and open a new window from there.

You are welcome to use the method that you feel the most comfortable with.

.debug[[shared/connecting.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/connecting.md)]
---

## Tmux cheat sheet

[Tmux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux) is a terminal multiplexer like `screen`.

*You don't have to use it or even know about it to follow along.
<br/>
But some of us like to use it to switch between terminals.
<br/>
It has been preinstalled on your workshop nodes.*

- Ctrl-b c ‚Üí creates a new window
- Ctrl-b n ‚Üí go to next window
- Ctrl-b p ‚Üí go to previous window
- Ctrl-b " ‚Üí split window top/bottom
- Ctrl-b % ‚Üí split window left/right
- Ctrl-b Alt-1 ‚Üí rearrange windows in columns
- Ctrl-b Alt-2 ‚Üí rearrange windows in rows
- Ctrl-b arrows ‚Üí navigate to other windows
- Ctrl-b d ‚Üí detach session
- tmux attach ‚Üí re-attach to session

# Our sample application

- We will clone the GitHub repository onto our `node1`

- The repository also contains scripts and tools that we will use through the workshop

.lab[

<!--
```bash
cd ~
if [ -d container.training ]; then
  mv container.training container.training.$RANDOM
fi
```
-->

- Clone the repository on `node1`:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training
  ```

]

(You can also fork the repository on GitHub and clone your fork if you prefer that.)

---

## Downloading and running the application

Let's start this before we look around, as downloading will take a little time...

.lab[

- Go to the `dockercoins` directory, in the cloned repository:
  ```bash
  cd ~/container.training/dockercoins
  ```

- Use Compose to build and run all containers:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

<!--
```longwait units of work done```
-->

]

Compose tells Docker to build all container images (pulling
the corresponding base images), then starts all containers,
and displays aggregated logs.

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

## What's this application?

--

- It is a DockerCoin miner! üí∞üê≥üì¶üö¢

--

- No, you can't buy coffee with DockerCoin

--

- How dockercoins works:

  - generate a few random bytes

  - hash these bytes

  - increment a counter (to keep track of speed)

  - repeat forever!

--

- DockerCoin is *not* a cryptocurrency

  (the only common points are "randomness," "hashing," and "coins" in the name)

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

## DockerCoin in the microservices era

- The dockercoins app is made of 5 services:

  - `rng` = web service generating random bytes

  - `hasher` = web service computing hash of POSTed data

  - `worker` = background process calling `rng` and `hasher`

  - `webui` = web interface to watch progress

  - `redis` = data store (holds a counter updated by `worker`)

- These 5 services are visible in the application's Compose file,
  [docker-compose.yml](
  https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/docker-compose.yml)

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

## How dockercoins works

- `worker` invokes web service `rng` to generate random bytes

- `worker` invokes web service `hasher` to hash these bytes

- `worker` does this in an infinite loop

- every second, `worker` updates `redis` to indicate how many loops were done

- `webui` queries `redis`, and computes and exposes "hashing speed" in our browser

*(See diagram on next slide!)*

## Service discovery in container-land

How does each service find out the address of the other ones?

--

- We do not hard-code IP addresses in the code

- We do not hard-code FQDNs in the code, either

- We just connect to a service name, and container-magic does the rest

  (And by container-magic, we mean "a crafty, dynamic, embedded DNS server")

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

## Example in `worker/worker.py`

```python
redis = Redis("`redis`")


def get_random_bytes():
    r = requests.get("http://`rng`/32")
    return r.content


def hash_bytes(data):
    r = requests.post("http://`hasher`/",
                      data=data,
                      headers={"Content-Type": "application/octet-stream"})
```

## Links, naming, and service discovery

- Containers can have network aliases (resolvable through DNS)

- Compose file version 2+ makes each container reachable through its service name

- Compose file version 1 required "links" sections to accomplish this

- Network aliases are automatically namespaced

  - you can have multiple apps declaring and using a service named `database`

  - containers in the blue app will resolve `database` to the IP of the blue database

  - containers in the green app will resolve `database` to the IP of the green database

## Show me the code!

- You can check the GitHub repository with all the materials of this workshop:
  <br/>https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training

- The application is in the [dockercoins](
  https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/tree/master/dockercoins)
  subdirectory

- The Compose file ([docker-compose.yml](
  https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/docker-compose.yml))
  lists all 5 services

- `redis` is using an official image from the Docker Hub

- `hasher`, `rng`, `worker`, `webui` are each built from a Dockerfile

- Each service's Dockerfile and source code is in its own directory

  (`hasher` is in the [hasher](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/hasher/) directory,
  `rng` is in the [rng](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/rng/)
  directory, etc.)

## Compose file format version

*This is relevant only if you have used Compose before 2016...*

- Compose 1.6 introduced support for a new Compose file format (aka "v2")

- Services are no longer at the top level, but under a `services` section

- There has to be a `version` key at the top level, with value `"2"` (as a string, not an integer)

- Containers are placed on a dedicated network, making links unnecessary

- There are other minor differences, but upgrade is easy and straightforward

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

## Our application at work

- On the left-hand side, the "rainbow strip" shows the container names

- On the right-hand side, we see the output of our containers

- We can see the `worker` service making requests to `rng` and `hasher`

- For `rng` and `hasher`, we see HTTP access logs

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

## Connecting to the web UI

- "Logs are exciting and fun!" (No-one, ever)

- The `webui` container exposes a web dashboard; let's view it

.lab[

- With a web browser, connect to `node1` on port 8000

- Remember: the `nodeX` aliases are valid only on the nodes themselves

- In your browser, you need to enter the IP address of your node

<!-- ```open http://node1:8000``` -->

]

A drawing area should show up, and after a few seconds, a blue
graph will appear.

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

class: self-paced, extra-details

## If the graph doesn't load

If you just see a `Page not found` error, it might be because your
Docker Engine is running on a different machine. This can be the case if:

- you are using the Docker Toolbox

- you are using a VM (local or remote) created with Docker Machine

- you are controlling a remote Docker Engine

When you run DockerCoins in development mode, the web UI static files
are mapped to the container using a volume. Alas, volumes can only
work on a local environment, or when using Docker Desktop for Mac or Windows.

How to fix this?

Stop the app with `^C`, edit `dockercoins.yml`, comment out the `volumes` section, and try again.

## Why does the speed seem irregular?

- It *looks like* the speed is approximately 4 hashes/second

- Or more precisely: 4 hashes/second, with regular dips down to zero

- Why?

--

class: extra-details

- The app actually has a constant, steady speed: 3.33 hashes/second
  <br/>
  (which corresponds to 1 hash every 0.3 seconds, for *reasons*)

- Yes, and?

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The reason why this graph is *not awesome*

- The worker doesn't update the counter after every loop, but up to once per second

- The speed is computed by the browser, checking the counter about once per second

- Between two consecutive updates, the counter will increase either by 4, or by 0

- The perceived speed will therefore be 4 - 4 - 4 - 0 - 4 - 4 - 0 etc.

- What can we conclude from this?

---

## Stopping the application

- If we interrupt Compose (with `^C`), it will politely ask the Docker Engine to stop the app

- The Docker Engine will send a `TERM` signal to the containers

- If the containers do not exit in a timely manner, the Engine sends a `KILL` signal

.lab[

- Stop the application by hitting `^C`

<!--
```key ^C```
-->

]

--

Some containers exit immediately, others take longer.

The containers that do not handle `SIGTERM` end up being killed after a 10s timeout. If we are very impatient, we can hit `^C` a second time!

## Clean up

- Before moving on, let's remove those containers

.lab[

- Tell Compose to remove everything:
  ```bash
  docker-compose down

# Kubernetes concepts

- Kubernetes is a container management system

- It runs and manages containerized applications on a cluster

--

- What does that really mean?

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## What can we do with Kubernetes?

- Let's imagine that we have a 3-tier e-commerce app:

  - web frontend

  - API backend

  - database (that we will keep out of Kubernetes for now)

- We have built images for our frontend and backend components

  (e.g. with Dockerfiles and `docker build`)

- We are running them successfully with a local environment

  (e.g. with Docker Compose)

- Let's see how we would deploy our app on Kubernetes!

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---


## Basic things we can ask Kubernetes to do

--

- Start 5 containers using image `atseashop/api:v1.3`

--

- Place an internal load balancer in front of these containers

--

- Start 10 containers using image `atseashop/webfront:v1.3`

--

- Place a public load balancer in front of these containers

--

- It's Black Friday (or Christmas), traffic spikes, grow our cluster and add containers

--

- New release! Replace my containers with the new image `atseashop/webfront:v1.4`

--

- Keep processing requests during the upgrade; update my containers one at a time

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## Other things that Kubernetes can do for us

- Autoscaling

  (straightforward on CPU; more complex on other metrics)

- Resource management and scheduling

  (reserve CPU/RAM for containers; placement constraints)

- Advanced rollout patterns

  (blue/green deployment, canary deployment)

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## More things that Kubernetes can do for us

- Batch jobs

  (one-off; parallel; also cron-style periodic execution)

- Fine-grained access control

  (defining *what* can be done by *whom* on *which* resources)

- Stateful services

  (databases, message queues, etc.)

- Automating complex tasks with *operators*

  (e.g. database replication, failover, etc.)

## Kubernetes architecture: the nodes

- The nodes executing our containers run a collection of services:

  - a container Engine (typically Docker)

  - kubelet (the "node agent")

  - kube-proxy (a necessary but not sufficient network component)

- Nodes were formerly called "minions"

  (You might see that word in older articles or documentation)

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## Kubernetes architecture: the control plane

- The Kubernetes logic (its "brains") is a collection of services:

  - the API server (our point of entry to everything!)

  - core services like the scheduler and controller manager

  - `etcd` (a highly available key/value store; the "database" of Kubernetes)

- Together, these services form the control plane of our cluster

- The control plane is also called the "master"

---

class: extra-details

## Running the control plane on special nodes

- It is common to reserve a dedicated node for the control plane

  (Except for single-node development clusters, like when using minikube)

- This node is then called a "master"

  (Yes, this is ambiguous: is the "master" a node, or the whole control plane?)

- Normal applications are restricted from running on this node

  (By using a mechanism called ["taints"](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/))

- When high availability is required, each service of the control plane must be resilient

- The control plane is then replicated on multiple nodes

  (This is sometimes called a "multi-master" setup)

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Running the control plane outside containers

- The services of the control plane can run in or out of containers

- For instance: since `etcd` is a critical service, some people
  deploy it directly on a dedicated cluster (without containers)

  (This is illustrated on the first "super complicated" schema)

- In some hosted Kubernetes offerings (e.g. AKS, GKE, EKS), the control plane is invisible

  (We only "see" a Kubernetes API endpoint)

- In that case, there is no "master node"

*For this reason, it is more accurate to say "control plane" rather than "master."*

## How many nodes should a cluster have?

- There is no particular constraint

  (no need to have an odd number of nodes for quorum)

- A cluster can have zero node

  (but then it won't be able to start any pods)

- For testing and development, having a single node is fine

- For production, make sure that you have extra capacity

  (so that your workload still fits if you lose a node or a group of nodes)

- Kubernetes is tested with [up to 5000 nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/cluster-large/)

  (however, running a cluster of that size requires a lot of tuning)

## Interacting with Kubernetes

- We will interact with our Kubernetes cluster through the Kubernetes API

- The Kubernetes API is (mostly) RESTful

- It allows us to create, read, update, delete *resources*

- A few common resource types are:

  - node (a machine ‚Äî physical or virtual ‚Äî in our cluster)

  - pod (group of containers running together on a node)

  - service (stable network endpoint to connect to one or multiple containers)

---

## Scaling

- How would we scale the pod shown on the previous slide?

- **Do** create additional pods

  - each pod can be on a different node

  - each pod will have its own IP address

- **Do not** add more NGINX containers in the pod

  - all the NGINX containers would be on the same node

  - they would all have the same IP address
    <br/>(resulting in `Address alreading in use` errors)

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## Together or separate

- Should we put e.g. a web application server and a cache together?
  <br/>
  ("cache" being something like e.g. Memcached or Redis)

- Putting them **in the same pod** means:

  - they have to be scaled together

  - they can communicate very efficiently over `localhost`

- Putting them **in different pods** means:

  - they can be scaled separately

  - they must communicate over remote IP addresses
    <br/>(incurring more latency, lower performance)

- Both scenarios can make sense, depending on our goals

# First contact with `kubectl`

- `kubectl` is (almost) the only tool we'll need to talk to Kubernetes

- It is a rich CLI tool around the Kubernetes API

  (Everything you can do with `kubectl`, you can do directly with the API)

- On our machines, there is a `~/.kube/config` file with:

  - the Kubernetes API address

  - the path to our TLS certificates used to authenticate

- You can also use the `--kubeconfig` flag to pass a config file

- Or directly `--server`, `--user`, etc.

- `kubectl` can be pronounced "Cube C T L", "Cube cuttle", "Cube cuddle"...

## `kubectl` is the new SSH

- We often start managing servers with SSH

  (installing packages, troubleshooting ...)

- At scale, it becomes tedious, repetitive, error-prone

- Instead, we use config management, central logging, etc.

- In many cases, we still need SSH:

  - as the underlying access method (e.g. Ansible)

  - to debug tricky scenarios

  - to inspect and poke at things

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]

## The parallel with `kubectl`

- We often start managing Kubernetes clusters with `kubectl`

  (deploying applications, troubleshooting ...)

- At scale (with many applications or clusters), it becomes tedious, repetitive, error-prone

- Instead, we use automated pipelines, observability tooling, etc.

- In many cases, we still need `kubectl`:

  - to debug tricky scenarios

  - to inspect and poke at things

- The Kubernetes API is always the underlying access method

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## `kubectl get`

- Let's look at our `Node` resources with `kubectl get`!

.lab[

- Look at the composition of our cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl get node
  ```

- These commands are equivalent:
  ```bash
  kubectl get no
  kubectl get node
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Obtaining machine-readable output

- `kubectl get` can output JSON, YAML, or be directly formatted

.lab[

- Give us more info about the nodes:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes -o wide
  ```

- Let's have some YAML:
  ```bash
  kubectl get no -o yaml
  ```
  See that `kind: List` at the end? It's the type of our result!

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## (Ab)using `kubectl` and `jq`

- It's super easy to build custom reports

.lab[

- Show the capacity of all our nodes as a stream of JSON objects:
  ```bash
    kubectl get nodes -o json |
            jq ".items[] | {name:.metadata.name} + .status.capacity"
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Exploring types and definitions

- We can list all available resource types by running `kubectl api-resources`
  <br/>
  (In Kubernetes 1.10 and prior, this command used to be `kubectl get`)

- We can view the definition for a resource type with:
  ```bash
  kubectl explain type
  ```

- We can view the definition of a field in a resource, for instance:
  ```bash
  kubectl explain node.spec
  ```

- Or get the full definition of all fields and sub-fields:
  ```bash
  kubectl explain node --recursive
  ```

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Introspection vs. documentation

- We can access the same information by reading the [API documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/#api-reference)

- The API documentation is usually easier to read, but:

  - it won't show custom types (like Custom Resource Definitions)

  - we need to make sure that we look at the correct version

- `kubectl api-resources` and `kubectl explain` perform *introspection*

  (they communicate with the API server and obtain the exact type definitions)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Type names

- The most common resource names have three forms:

  - singular (e.g. `node`, `service`, `deployment`)

  - plural (e.g. `nodes`, `services`, `deployments`)

  - short (e.g. `no`, `svc`, `deploy`)

- Some resources do not have a short name

- `Endpoints` only have a plural form

  (because even a single `Endpoints` resource is actually a list of endpoints)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Viewing details

- We can use `kubectl get -o yaml` to see all available details

- However, YAML output is often simultaneously too much and not enough

- For instance, `kubectl get node node1 -o yaml` is:

  - too much information (e.g.: list of images available on this node)

  - not enough information (e.g.: doesn't show pods running on this node)

  - difficult to read for a human operator

- For a comprehensive overview, we can use `kubectl describe` instead

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## `kubectl describe`

- `kubectl describe` needs a resource type and (optionally) a resource name

- It is possible to provide a resource name *prefix*

  (all matching objects will be displayed)

- `kubectl describe` will retrieve some extra information about the resource

.lab[

- Look at the information available for `node1` with one of the following commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe node/node1
  kubectl describe node node1
  ```

]

(We should notice a bunch of control plane pods.)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Listing running containers

- Containers are manipulated through *pods*

- A pod is a group of containers:

 - running together (on the same node)

 - sharing resources (RAM, CPU; but also network, volumes)

.lab[

- List pods on our cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

--

*Where are the pods that we saw just a moment earlier?!?*

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Namespaces

- Namespaces allow us to segregate resources

.lab[

- List the namespaces on our cluster with one of these commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl get namespaces
  kubectl get namespace
  kubectl get ns
  ```

]

--

*You know what ... This `kube-system` thing looks suspicious.*

*In fact, I'm pretty sure it showed up earlier, when we did:*

`kubectl describe node node1`

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Accessing namespaces

- By default, `kubectl` uses the `default` namespace

- We can see resources in all namespaces with `--all-namespaces`

.lab[

- List the pods in all namespaces:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
  ```

- Since Kubernetes 1.14, we can also use `-A` as a shorter version:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -A
  ```

]

*Here are our system pods!*

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## What are all these control plane pods?

- `etcd` is our etcd server

- `kube-apiserver` is the API server

- `kube-controller-manager` and `kube-scheduler` are other control plane components

- `coredns` provides DNS-based service discovery ([replacing kube-dns as of 1.11](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/07/10/coredns-ga-for-kubernetes-cluster-dns/))

- `kube-proxy` is the (per-node) component managing port mappings and such

- `weave` is the (per-node) component managing the network overlay

- the `READY` column indicates the number of containers in each pod

  (1 for most pods, but `weave` has 2, for instance)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Scoping another namespace

- We can also look at a different namespace (other than `default`)

.lab[

- List only the pods in the `kube-system` namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system
  kubectl get pods -n kube-system
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Namespaces and other `kubectl` commands

- We can use `-n`/`--namespace` with almost every `kubectl` command

- Example:

  - `kubectl create --namespace=X` to create something in namespace X

- We can use `-A`/`--all-namespaces` with most commands that manipulate multiple objects

- Examples:

  - `kubectl delete` can delete resources across multiple namespaces

  - `kubectl label` can add/remove/update labels across multiple namespaces

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## What about `kube-public`?

.lab[

- List the pods in the `kube-public` namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-public get pods
  ```

]

Nothing!

`kube-public` is created by kubeadm & [used for security bootstrapping](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/01/stronger-foundation-for-creating-and-managing-kubernetes-clusters).

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Exploring `kube-public`

- The only interesting object in `kube-public` is a ConfigMap named `cluster-info`

.lab[

- List ConfigMap objects:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-public get configmaps
  ```

- Inspect `cluster-info`:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-public get configmap cluster-info -o yaml
  ```

]

Note the `selfLink` URI: `/api/v1/namespaces/kube-public/configmaps/cluster-info`

We can use that!

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Accessing `cluster-info`

- Earlier, when trying to access the API server, we got a `Forbidden` message

- But `cluster-info` is readable by everyone (even without authentication)

.lab[

- Retrieve `cluster-info`:
  ```bash
  curl -k https://10.96.0.1/api/v1/namespaces/kube-public/configmaps/cluster-info
  ```

]

- We were able to access `cluster-info` (without auth)

- It contains a `kubeconfig` file

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Retrieving `kubeconfig`

- We can easily extract the `kubeconfig` file from this ConfigMap

.lab[

- Display the content of `kubeconfig`:
  ```bash
    curl -sk https://10.96.0.1/api/v1/namespaces/kube-public/configmaps/cluster-info \
         | jq -r .data.kubeconfig
  ```

]

- This file holds the canonical address of the API server, and the public key of the CA

- This file *does not* hold client keys or tokens

- This is not sensitive information, but allows us to establish trust

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## What about `kube-node-lease`?

- Starting with Kubernetes 1.14, there is a `kube-node-lease` namespace

  (or in Kubernetes 1.13 if the NodeLease feature gate is enabled)

- That namespace contains one Lease object per node

- *Node leases* are a new way to implement node heartbeats

  (i.e. node regularly pinging the control plane to say "I'm alive!")

- For more details, see [KEP-0009] or the [node controller documentation]

[KEP-0009]: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/0009-node-heartbeat.md
[node controller documentation]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/#node-controller

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Services

- A *service* is a stable endpoint to connect to "something"

  (In the initial proposal, they were called "portals")

.lab[

- List the services on our cluster with one of these commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl get services
  kubectl get svc
  ```

]

--

There is already one service on our cluster: the Kubernetes API itself.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## ClusterIP services

- A `ClusterIP` service is internal, available from the cluster only

- This is useful for introspection from within containers

.lab[

- Try to connect to the API:
  ```bash
  curl -k https://`10.96.0.1`
  ```

  - `-k` is used to skip certificate verification

  - Make sure to replace 10.96.0.1 with the CLUSTER-IP shown by `kubectl get svc`

]

The command above should either time out, or show an authentication error. Why?

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Time out

- Connections to ClusterIP services only work *from within the cluster*

- If we are outside the cluster, the `curl` command will probably time out

  (Because the IP address, e.g. 10.96.0.1, isn't routed properly outside the cluster)

- This is the case with most "real" Kubernetes clusters

- To try the connection from within the cluster, we can use [shpod](https://github.com/jpetazzo/shpod)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Authentication error

This is what we should see when connecting from within the cluster:
```json
$ curl -k https://10.96.0.1
{
  "kind": "Status",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {

  },
  "status": "Failure",
  "message": "forbidden: User \"system:anonymous\" cannot get path \"/\"",
  "reason": "Forbidden",
  "details": {

  },
  "code": 403
}
```

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Explanations

- We can see `kind`, `apiVersion`, `metadata`

- These are typical of a Kubernetes API reply

- Because we *are* talking to the Kubernetes API

- The Kubernetes API tells us "Forbidden"

  (because it requires authentication)

- The Kubernetes API is reachable from within the cluster

  (many apps integrating with Kubernetes will use this)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## DNS integration

- Each service also gets a DNS record

- The Kubernetes DNS resolver is available *from within pods*

  (and sometimes, from within nodes, depending on configuration)

- Code running in pods can connect to services using their name

  (e.g. https://kubernetes/...)

# Running our first containers on Kubernetes

- First things first: we cannot run a container

--

- We are going to run a pod, and in that pod there will be a single container

--

- In that container in the pod, we are going to run a simple `ping` command

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## If you're running Kubernetes 1.17 (or older)...

- This material assumes that you're running a recent version of Kubernetes

  (at least 1.19) <!-- ##VERSION## -->

- You can check your version number with `kubectl version`

  (look at the server part)

- In Kubernetes 1.17 and older, `kubectl run` creates a Deployment

- If you're running such an old version:

  - it's obsolete and no longer maintained

  - Kubernetes 1.17 is [EOL since January 2021][nonactive]

  - **upgrade NOW!**

[nonactive]: https://kubernetes.io/releases/patch-releases/#non-active-branch-history

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Starting a simple pod with `kubectl run`

- `kubectl run` is convenient to start a single pod

- We need to specify at least a *name* and the image we want to use

- Optionally, we can specify the command to run in the pod

.lab[

- Let's ping the address of `localhost`, the loopback interface:
  ```bash
  kubectl run pingpong --image alpine ping 127.0.0.1
  ```

<!-- ```hide kubectl wait pod --selector=run=pingpong --for condition=ready``` -->

]

The output tells us that a Pod was created:
```
pod/pingpong created
```

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Viewing container output

- Let's use the `kubectl logs` command

- It takes a Pod name as argument

- Unless specified otherwise, it will only show logs of the first container in the pod

  (Good thing there's only one in ours!)

.lab[

- View the result of our `ping` command:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs pingpong
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Streaming logs in real time

- Just like `docker logs`, `kubectl logs` supports convenient options:

  - `-f`/`--follow` to stream logs in real time (√† la `tail -f`)

  - `--tail` to indicate how many lines you want to see (from the end)

  - `--since` to get logs only after a given timestamp

.lab[

- View the latest logs of our `ping` command:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs pingpong --tail 1 --follow
  ```

- Stop it with Ctrl-C

<!--
```wait seq=3```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Scaling our application

- `kubectl` gives us a simple command to scale a workload:

  `kubectl scale TYPE NAME --replicas=HOWMANY`

- Let's try it on our Pod, so that we have more Pods!

.lab[

- Try to scale the Pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale pod pingpong --replicas=3
  ```

]

ü§î We get the following error, what does that mean?

```
Error from server (NotFound): the server could not find the requested resource
```

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Scaling a Pod

- We cannot "scale a Pod"

  (that's not completely true; we could give it more CPU/RAM)

- If we want more Pods, we need to create more Pods

  (i.e. execute `kubectl run` multiple times)

- There must be a better way!

  (spoiler alert: yes, there is a better way!)

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## `NotFound`

- What's the meaning of that error?
  ```
  Error from server (NotFound): the server could not find the requested resource
  ```

- When we execute `kubectl scale THAT-RESOURCE --replicas=THAT-MANY`,
  <br/>
  it is like telling Kubernetes:

  *go to THAT-RESOURCE and set the scaling button to position THAT-MANY*

- Pods do not have a "scaling button"

- Try to execute the `kubectl scale pod` command with `-v6`

- We see a `PATCH` request to `/scale`: that's the "scaling button"

  (technically it's called a *subresource* of the Pod)

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Creating more pods

- We are going to create a ReplicaSet

  (= set of replicas = set of identical pods)

- In fact, we will create a Deployment, which itself will create a ReplicaSet

- Why so many layers? We'll explain that shortly, don't worry!

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Creating a Deployment running `ping`

- Let's create a Deployment instead of a single Pod

.lab[

- Create the Deployment; pay attention to the `--`:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment pingpong --image=alpine -- ping 127.0.0.1
  ```

]

- The `--` is used to separate:

  - "options/flags of `kubectl create`

  - command to run in the container

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## What has been created?

.lab[

<!-- ```hide kubectl wait pod --selector=app=pingpong --for condition=ready ``` -->

- Check the resources that were created:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

Note: `kubectl get all` is a lie. It doesn't show everything.

(But it shows a lot of "usual suspects", i.e. commonly used resources.)

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## There's a lot going on here!

```

```

Our new Pod is not named `pingpong`, but `pingpong-xxxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy`.

We have a Deployment named `pingpong`, and an extra ReplicaSet, too. What's going on?

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## From Deployment to Pod

We have the following resources:

- `deployment.apps/pingpong`

  This is the Deployment that we just created.

- `replicaset.apps/pingpong-xxxxxxxxxx`

  This is a Replica Set created by this Deployment.

- `pod/pingpong-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy`

  This is a *pod* created by the Replica Set.

Let's explain what these things are.

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Pod

- Can have one or multiple containers

- Runs on a single node

  (Pod cannot "straddle" multiple nodes)

- Pods cannot be moved

  (e.g. in case of node outage)

- Pods cannot be scaled horizontally

  (except by manually creating more Pods)

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Pod details

- A Pod is not a process; it's an environment for containers

  - it cannot be "restarted"

  - it cannot "crash"

- The containers in a Pod can crash

- They may or may not get restarted

  (depending on Pod's restart policy)

- If all containers exit successfully, the Pod ends in "Succeeded" phase

- If some containers fail and don't get restarted, the Pod ends in "Failed" phase

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Replica Set

- Set of identical (replicated) Pods

- Defined by a pod template + number of desired replicas

- If there are not enough Pods, the Replica Set creates more

  (e.g. in case of node outage; or simply when scaling up)

- If there are too many Pods, the Replica Set deletes some

  (e.g. if a node was disconnected and comes back; or when scaling down)

- We can scale up/down a Replica Set

  - we update the manifest of the Replica Set

  - as a consequence, the Replica Set controller creates/deletes Pods

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Deployment

- Replica Sets control *identical* Pods

- Deployments are used to roll out different Pods

  (different image, command, environment variables, ...)

- When we update a Deployment with a new Pod definition:

  - a new Replica Set is created with the new Pod definition

  - that new Replica Set is progressively scaled up

  - meanwhile, the old Replica Set(s) is(are) scaled down

- This is a *rolling update*, minimizing application downtime

- When we scale up/down a Deployment, it scales up/down its Replica Set

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Can we scale now?

- Let's try `kubectl scale` again, but on the Deployment!

.lab[

- Scale our `pingpong` deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment pingpong --replicas 3
  ```

- Note that we could also write it like this:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment/pingpong --replicas 3
  ```

- Check that we now have multiple pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Scaling a Replica Set

- What if we scale the Replica Set instead of the Deployment?

- The Deployment would notice it right away and scale back to the initial level

- The Replica Set makes sure that we have the right numbers of Pods

- The Deployment makes sure that the Replica Set has the right size

  (conceptually, it delegates the management of the Pods to the Replica Set)

- This might seem weird (why this extra layer?) but will soon make sense

  (when we will look at how rolling updates work!)

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Checking Deployment logs

- `kubectl logs` needs a Pod name

- But it can also work with a *type/name*

  (e.g. `deployment/pingpong`)

.lab[

- View the result of our `ping` command:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/pingpong --tail 2
  ```

]

- It shows us the logs of the first Pod of the Deployment

- We'll see later how to get the logs of *all* the Pods!

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Resilience

- The *deployment* `pingpong` watches its *replica set*

- The *replica set* ensures that the right number of *pods* are running

- What happens if pods disappear?

.lab[

- In a separate window, watch the list of pods:
  ```bash
  watch kubectl get pods
  ```

<!--
```wait Every 2.0s```
```tmux split-pane -v```
-->

- Destroy the pod currently shown by `kubectl logs`:
  ```
  kubectl delete pod pingpong-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy
  ```

<!--
```tmux select-pane -t 0```
```copy pingpong-[^-]*-.....```
```tmux last-pane```
```keys kubectl delete pod ```
```paste```
```key ^J```
```check```
-->

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## What happened?

- `kubectl delete pod` terminates the pod gracefully

  (sending it the TERM signal and waiting for it to shutdown)

- As soon as the pod is in "Terminating" state, the Replica Set replaces it

- But we can still see the output of the "Terminating" pod in `kubectl logs`

- Until 30 seconds later, when the grace period expires

- The pod is then killed, and `kubectl logs` exits

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Deleting a standalone Pod

- What happens if we delete a standalone Pod?
 
  (like the first `pingpong` Pod that we created)

.lab[

- Delete the Pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete pod pingpong
  ```

<!--
```key ^D```
```key ^C```
-->

]

- No replacement Pod gets created because there is no *controller* watching it

- That's why we will rarely use standalone Pods in practice

  (except for e.g. punctual debugging or executing a short supervised task)

# Executing batch jobs

- Deployments are great for stateless web apps

  (as well as workers that keep running forever)

- Pods are great for one-off execution that we don't care about

  (because they don't get automatically restarted if something goes wrong)

- Jobs are great for "long" background work

  ("long" being at least minutes or hours)

- CronJobs are great to schedule Jobs at regular intervals

  (just like the classic UNIX `cron` daemon with its `crontab` files)

.debug[[k8s/batch-jobs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/batch-jobs.md)]

## Creating a Job

- A Job will create a Pod

- If the Pod fails, the Job will create another one

- The Job will keep trying until:

  - either a Pod succeeds,

  - or we hit the *backoff limit* of the Job (default=6)

.lab[

- Create a Job that has a 50% chance of success:
  ```bash
    kubectl create job flipcoin --image=alpine -- sh -c 'exit $(($RANDOM%2))' 
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/batch-jobs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/batch-jobs.md)]
---

## Our Job in action

- Our Job will create a Pod named `flipcoin-xxxxx`

- If the Pod succeeds, the Job stops

- If the Pod fails, the Job creates another Pod

.lab[

- Check the status of the Pod(s) created by the Job:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --selector=job-name=flipcoin
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/batch-jobs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/batch-jobs.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## More advanced jobs

- We can specify a number of "completions" (default=1)

- This indicates how many times the Job must be executed

- We can specify the "parallelism" (default=1)

- This indicates how many Pods should be running in parallel

- These options cannot be specified with `kubectl create job`

  (we have to write our own YAML manifest to use them)

.debug[[k8s/batch-jobs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/batch-jobs.md)]
---

## Scheduling periodic background work

- A Cron Job is a Job that will be executed at specific intervals

  (the name comes from the traditional cronjobs executed by the UNIX crond)

- It requires a *schedule*, represented as five space-separated fields:

  - minute [0,59]
  - hour [0,23]
  - day of the month [1,31]
  - month of the year [1,12]
  - day of the week ([0,6] with 0=Sunday)

- `*` means "all valid values"; `/N` means "every N"

- Example: `*/3 * * * *` means "every three minutes"

- The website https://crontab.guru/ can help to create cron schedules!

.debug[[k8s/batch-jobs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/batch-jobs.md)]
---

## Creating a Cron Job

- Let's create a simple job to be executed every three minutes

- Careful: make sure that the job terminates!

  (The Cron Job will not hold if a previous job is still running)

.lab[

- Create the Cron Job:
  ```bash
    kubectl create cronjob every3mins --schedule="*/3 * * * *" \
            --image=alpine -- sleep 10
  ```

- Check the resource that was created:
  ```bash
  kubectl get cronjobs
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/batch-jobs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/batch-jobs.md)]
---

## Cron Jobs in action

- At the specified schedule, the Cron Job will create a Job

- The Job will create a Pod

- The Job will make sure that the Pod completes

  (re-creating another one if it fails, for instance if its node fails)

.lab[

- Check the Jobs that are created:
  ```bash
  kubectl get jobs
  ```

]

(It will take a few minutes before the first job is scheduled.)

.debug[[k8s/batch-jobs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/batch-jobs.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Setting a time limit

- It is possible to set a time limit (or deadline) for a job

- This is done with the field `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds`

  (by default, it is unlimited)

- When the job is older than this time limit, all its pods are terminated

- Note that there can also be a `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds` field in pods!

- They can be set independently, and have different effects:

  - the deadline of the job will stop the entire job

  - the deadline of the pod will only stop an individual pod

# Labels and annotations

- Most Kubernetes resources can have *labels* and *annotations*

- Both labels and annotations are arbitrary strings

  (with some limitations that we'll explain in a minute)

- Both labels and annotations can be added, removed, changed, dynamically

- This can be done with:

  - the `kubectl edit` command

  - the `kubectl label` and `kubectl annotate`

  - ... many other ways! (`kubectl apply -f`, `kubectl patch`, ...)

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

## Viewing labels and annotations

- Let's see what we get when we create a Deployment

.lab[

- Create a Deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment clock --image=jpetazzo/clock
  ```

- Look at its annotations and labels:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe deployment clock
  ```

]

So, what do we get?

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

## Labels and annotations for our Deployment

- We see one label:
  ```
  Labels: app=clock
  ```

- This is added by `kubectl create deployment`

- And one annotation:
  ```
  Annotations: deployment.kubernetes.io/revision: 1
  ```

- This is to keep track of successive versions when doing rolling updates

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

## And for the related Pod?

- Let's look up the Pod that was created and check it too

.lab[

- Find the name of the Pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

- Display its information:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod clock-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy
  ```

]

So, what do we get?

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

## Labels and annotations for our Pod

- We see two labels:
  ```
    Labels: app=clock
            pod-template-hash=xxxxxxxxxx
  ```

- `app=clock` comes from `kubectl create deployment` too

- `pod-template-hash` was assigned by the Replica Set

  (when we will do rolling updates, each set of Pods will have a different hash)

- There are no annotations:
  ```
  Annotations: <none>
  ```

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

## Selectors

- A *selector* is an expression matching labels

- It will restrict a command to the objects matching *at least* all these labels

.lab[

- List all the pods with at least `app=clock`:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --selector=app=clock
  ```

- List all the pods with a label `app`, regardless of its value:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --selector=app
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

## Settings labels and annotations

- The easiest method is to use `kubectl label` and `kubectl annotate`

.lab[

- Set a label on the `clock` Deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl label deployment clock color=blue
  ```

- Check it out:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe deployment clock
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

## Other ways to view labels

- `kubectl get` gives us a couple of useful flags to check labels

- `kubectl get --show-labels` shows all labels

- `kubectl get -L xyz` shows the value of label `xyz`

.lab[

- List all the labels that we have on pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --show-labels
  ```

- List the value of label `app` on these pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -L app
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## More on selectors

- If a selector has multiple labels, it means "match at least these labels"

  Example: `--selector=app=frontend,release=prod`

- `--selector` can be abbreviated as `-l` (for **l**abels)

  We can also use negative selectors

  Example: `--selector=app!=clock`

- Selectors can be used with most `kubectl` commands

  Examples: `kubectl delete`, `kubectl label`, ...

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

## Other ways to view labels

- We can use the `--show-labels` flag with `kubectl get`

.lab[

- Show labels for a bunch of objects:
  ```bash
  kubectl get --show-labels po,rs,deploy,svc,no
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

## Differences between labels and annotations

- The *key* for both labels and annotations:

  - must start and end with a letter or digit

  - can also have `.` `-` `_` (but not in first or last position)

  - can be up to 63 characters, or 253 + `/` + 63

- Label *values* are up to 63 characters, with the same restrictions

- Annotations *values* can have arbitrary characters (yes, even binary)

- Maximum length isn't defined

  (dozens of kilobytes is fine, hundreds maybe not so much)

# Revisiting `kubectl logs`

- In this section, we assume that we have a Deployment with multiple Pods

  (e.g. `pingpong` that we scaled to at least 3 pods)

- We will highlights some of the limitations of `kubectl logs`

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-logs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-logs.md)]
---

## Streaming logs of multiple pods

- By default, `kubectl logs` shows us the output of a single Pod

.lab[

- Try to check the output of the Pods related to a Deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/pingpong --tail 1 --follow
  ```

<!--
```wait using pod/pingpong-```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

`kubectl logs` only shows us the logs of one of the Pods.

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-logs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-logs.md)]
---

## Viewing logs of multiple pods

- When we specify a deployment name, only one single pod's logs are shown

- We can view the logs of multiple pods by specifying a *selector*

- If we check the pods created by the deployment, they all have the label `app=pingpong`

  (this is just a default label that gets added when using `kubectl create deployment`)

.lab[

- View the last line of log from all pods with the `app=pingpong` label:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l app=pingpong --tail 1
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-logs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-logs.md)]
---

## Streaming logs of multiple pods

- Can we stream the logs of all our `pingpong` pods?

.lab[

- Combine `-l` and `-f` flags:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l app=pingpong --tail 1 -f
  ```

<!--
```wait seq=```
```key ^C```
-->

]

*Note: combining `-l` and `-f` is only possible since Kubernetes 1.14!*

*Let's try to understand why ...*

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-logs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-logs.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Streaming logs of many pods

- Let's see what happens if we try to stream the logs for more than 5 pods

.lab[

- Scale up our deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment pingpong --replicas=8
  ```

- Stream the logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l app=pingpong --tail 1 -f
  ```

<!-- ```wait error:``` -->

]

We see a message like the following one:
```
error: you are attempting to follow 8 log streams,
but maximum allowed concurency is 5,
use --max-log-requests to increase the limit
```

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-logs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-logs.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Why can't we stream the logs of many pods?

- `kubectl` opens one connection to the API server per pod

- For each pod, the API server opens one extra connection to the corresponding kubelet

- If there are 1000 pods in our deployment, that's 1000 inbound + 1000 outbound connections on the API server

- This could easily put a lot of stress on the API server

- Prior Kubernetes 1.14, it was decided to *not* allow multiple connections

- From Kubernetes 1.14, it is allowed, but limited to 5 connections

  (this can be changed with `--max-log-requests`)

- For more details about the rationale, see
  [PR #67573](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67573)

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-logs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-logs.md)]
---

## Shortcomings of `kubectl logs`

- We don't see which pod sent which log line

- If pods are restarted / replaced, the log stream stops

- If new pods are added, we don't see their logs

- To stream the logs of multiple pods, we need to write a selector

- There are external tools to address these shortcomings

  (e.g.: [Stern](https://github.com/wercker/stern))

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-logs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectl-logs.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## `kubectl logs -l ... --tail N`

- If we run this with Kubernetes 1.12, the last command shows multiple lines

- This is a regression when `--tail` is used together with `-l`/`--selector`

- It always shows the last 10 lines of output for each container

  (instead of the number of lines specified on the command line)

- The problem was fixed in Kubernetes 1.13

*See [#70554](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/70554) for details.*

# Accessing logs from the CLI

- The `kubectl logs` command has limitations:

  - it cannot stream logs from multiple pods at a time

  - when showing logs from multiple pods, it mixes them all together

- We are going to see how to do it better

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Doing it manually

- We *could* (if we were so inclined) write a program or script that would:

  - take a selector as an argument

  - enumerate all pods matching that selector (with `kubectl get -l ...`)

  - fork one `kubectl logs --follow ...` command per container

  - annotate the logs (the output of each `kubectl logs ...` process) with their origin

  - preserve ordering by using `kubectl logs --timestamps ...` and merge the output

--

- We *could* do it, but thankfully, others did it for us already!

## Stern

[Stern](https://github.com/stern/stern) is an open source project
originally by [Wercker](http://www.wercker.com/).

From the README:

*Stern allows you to tail multiple pods on Kubernetes and multiple containers within the pod. Each result is color coded for quicker debugging.*

*The query is a regular expression so the pod name can easily be filtered and you don't need to specify the exact id (for instance omitting the deployment id). If a pod is deleted it gets removed from tail and if a new pod is added it automatically gets tailed.*

Exactly what we need!

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Checking if Stern is installed

- Run `stern` (without arguments) to check if it's installed:

  ```
  $ stern
  Tail multiple pods and containers from Kubernetes

  Usage:
    stern pod-query [flags]
  ```

- If it's missing, let's see how to install it

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Installing Stern

- Stern is written in Go

- Go programs are usually very easy to install

  (no dependencies, extra libraries to install, etc)

- Binary releases are available [here](https://github.com/stern/stern/releases) on GitHub

- Stern is also available through most package managers

  (e.g. on macOS, we can `brew install stern` or `sudo port install stern`)

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Using Stern

- There are two ways to specify the pods whose logs we want to see:

  - `-l` followed by a selector expression (like with many `kubectl` commands)

  - with a "pod query," i.e. a regex used to match pod names

- These two ways can be combined if necessary

.lab[

- View the logs for all the pingpong containers:
  ```bash
  stern pingpong
  ```

<!--
```wait seq=```
```key ^C```
-->

]

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Stern convenient options

- The `--tail N` flag shows the last `N` lines for each container

  (Instead of showing the logs since the creation of the container)

- The `-t` / `--timestamps` flag shows timestamps

- The `--all-namespaces` flag is self-explanatory

.lab[

- View what's up with the `weave` system containers:
  ```bash
  stern --tail 1 --timestamps --all-namespaces weave
  ```

<!--
```wait weave-npc```
```key ^C```
-->

]

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Using Stern with a selector

- When specifying a selector, we can omit the value for a label

- This will match all objects having that label (regardless of the value)

- Everything created with `kubectl run` has a label `run`

- Everything created with `kubectl create deployment` has a label `app`

- We can use that property to view the logs of all the pods created with `kubectl create deployment`

.lab[

- View the logs for all the things started with `kubectl create deployment`:
  ```bash
  stern -l app
  ```

<!--
```wait seq=```
```key ^C```
-->

# Declarative vs imperative

- Our container orchestrator puts a very strong emphasis on being *declarative*

- Declarative:

  *I would like a cup of tea.*

- Imperative:

  *Boil some water. Pour it in a teapot. Add tea leaves. Steep for a while. Serve in a cup.*

--

- Declarative seems simpler at first ... 

--

- ... As long as you know how to brew tea

.debug[[shared/declarative.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/declarative.md)]
---

## Declarative vs imperative

- What declarative would really be:

  *I want a cup of tea, obtained by pouring an infusion¬π of tea leaves in a cup.*

--

  *¬πAn infusion is obtained by letting the object steep a few minutes in hot¬≤ water.*

--

  *¬≤Hot liquid is obtained by pouring it in an appropriate container¬≥ and setting it on a stove.*

--

  *¬≥Ah, finally, containers! Something we know about. Let's get to work, shall we?*

--

.footnote[Did you know there was an [ISO standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3103)
specifying how to brew tea?]

.debug[[shared/declarative.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/declarative.md)]
---

## Declarative vs imperative

- Imperative systems:

  - simpler

  - if a task is interrupted, we have to restart from scratch

- Declarative systems:

  - if a task is interrupted (or if we show up to the party half-way through),
    we can figure out what's missing and do only what's necessary

  - we need to be able to *observe* the system

  - ... and compute a "diff" between *what we have* and *what we want*

.debug[[shared/declarative.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/shared/declarative.md)]
---
## Declarative vs imperative in Kubernetes

- With Kubernetes, we cannot say: "run this container"

- All we can do is write a *spec* and push it to the API server

  (by creating a resource like e.g. a Pod or a Deployment)

- The API server will validate that spec (and reject it if it's invalid)

- Then it will store it in etcd

- A *controller* will "notice" that spec and act upon it

.debug[[k8s/declarative.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/declarative.md)]
---

## Reconciling state

- Watch for the `spec` fields in the YAML files later!

- The *spec* describes *how we want the thing to be*

- Kubernetes will *reconcile* the current state with the spec
  <br/>(technically, this is done by a number of *controllers*)

- When we want to change some resource, we update the *spec*

- Kubernetes will then *converge* that resource

# Kubernetes network model

- TL,DR:

  *Our cluster (nodes and pods) is one big flat IP network.*

--

- In detail:

 - all nodes must be able to reach each other, without NAT

 - all pods must be able to reach each other, without NAT

 - pods and nodes must be able to reach each other, without NAT

 - each pod is aware of its IP address (no NAT)

 - pod IP addresses are assigned by the network implementation

- Kubernetes doesn't mandate any particular implementation

.debug[[k8s/kubenet.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubenet.md)]
---

## Kubernetes network model: the good

- Everything can reach everything

- No address translation

- No port translation

- No new protocol

- The network implementation can decide how to allocate addresses

- IP addresses don't have to be "portable" from a node to another

  (We can use e.g. a subnet per node and use a simple routed topology)

- The specification is simple enough to allow many various implementations

.debug[[k8s/kubenet.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubenet.md)]
---

## Kubernetes network model: the less good

- Everything can reach everything

  - if you want security, you need to add network policies

  - the network implementation that you use needs to support them

- There are literally dozens of implementations out there

  (https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/ lists more than 25 plugins)

- Pods have level 3 (IP) connectivity, but *services* are level 4 (TCP or UDP)

  (Services map to a single UDP or TCP port; no port ranges or arbitrary IP packets)

- `kube-proxy` is on the data path when connecting to a pod or container,
  <br/>and it's not particularly fast (relies on userland proxying or iptables)

.debug[[k8s/kubenet.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubenet.md)]
---

## Kubernetes network model: in practice

- The nodes that we are using have been set up to use [Weave](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave)

- We don't endorse Weave in a particular way, it just Works For Us

- Don't worry about the warning about `kube-proxy` performance

- Unless you:

  - routinely saturate 10G network interfaces
  - count packet rates in millions per second
  - run high-traffic VOIP or gaming platforms
  - do weird things that involve millions of simultaneous connections
    <br/>(in which case you're already familiar with kernel tuning)

- If necessary, there are alternatives to `kube-proxy`; e.g.
  [`kube-router`](https://www.kube-router.io)

.debug[[k8s/kubenet.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubenet.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The Container Network Interface (CNI)

- Most Kubernetes clusters use CNI "plugins" to implement networking

- When a pod is created, Kubernetes delegates the network setup to these plugins

  (it can be a single plugin, or a combination of plugins, each doing one task)

- Typically, CNI plugins will:

  - allocate an IP address (by calling an IPAM plugin)

  - add a network interface into the pod's network namespace

  - configure the interface as well as required routes etc.

.debug[[k8s/kubenet.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubenet.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Multiple moving parts

- The "pod-to-pod network" or "pod network":

  - provides communication between pods and nodes

  - is generally implemented with CNI plugins

- The "pod-to-service network":

  - provides internal communication and load balancing

  - is generally implemented with kube-proxy (or e.g. kube-router)

- Network policies:

  - provide firewalling and isolation

  - can be bundled with the "pod network" or provided by another component

class: extra-details

## Even more moving parts

- Inbound traffic can be handled by multiple components:

  - something like kube-proxy or kube-router (for NodePort services)

  - load balancers (ideally, connected to the pod network)

- It is possible to use multiple pod networks in parallel

  (with "meta-plugins" like CNI-Genie or Multus)

- Some solutions can fill multiple roles

  (e.g. kube-router can be set up to provide the pod network and/or network policies and/or replace kube-proxy)

# Exposing containers

- We can connect to our pods using their IP address

- Then we need to figure out a lot of things:

  - how do we look up the IP address of the pod(s)?

  - how do we connect from outside the cluster?

  - how do we load balance traffic?

  - what if a pod fails?

- Kubernetes has a resource type named *Service*

- Services address all these questions!

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Services in a nutshell

- Services give us a *stable endpoint* to connect to a pod or a group of pods

- An easy way to create a service is to use `kubectl expose`

- If we have a deployment named `my-little-deploy`, we can run:

  `kubectl expose deployment my-little-deploy --port=80`

  ... and this will create a service with the same name (`my-little-deploy`)

- Services are automatically added to an internal DNS zone

  (in the example above, our code can now connect to http://my-little-deploy/)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Advantages of services

- We don't need to look up the IP address of the pod(s)

  (we resolve the IP address of the service using DNS)

- There are multiple service types; some of them allow external traffic

  (e.g. `LoadBalancer` and `NodePort`)

- Services provide load balancing

  (for both internal and external traffic)

- Service addresses are independent from pods' addresses

  (when a pod fails, the service seamlessly sends traffic to its replacement)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Many kinds and flavors of service

- There are different types of services:

  `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer`, `ExternalName`

- There are also *headless services*

- Services can also have optional *external IPs*

- There is also another resource type called *Ingress*

  (specifically for HTTP services)

- Wow, that's a lot! Let's start with the basics ...

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## `ClusterIP`

- It's the default service type

- A virtual IP address is allocated for the service

  (in an internal, private range; e.g. 10.96.0.0/12)

- This IP address is reachable only from within the cluster (nodes and pods)

- Our code can connect to the service using the original port number

- Perfect for internal communication, within the cluster

---

## `LoadBalancer`

- An external load balancer is allocated for the service

  (typically a cloud load balancer, e.g. ELB on AWS, GLB on GCE ...)

- This is available only when the underlying infrastructure provides some kind of
  "load balancer as a service"

- Each service of that type will typically cost a little bit of money

  (e.g. a few cents per hour on AWS or GCE)

- Ideally, traffic would flow directly from the load balancer to the pods

- In practice, it will often flow through a `NodePort` first

---

## `NodePort`

- A port number is allocated for the service

  (by default, in the 30000-32767 range)

- That port is made available *on all our nodes* and anybody can connect to it

  (we can connect to any node on that port to reach the service)

- Our code needs to be changed to connect to that new port number

- Under the hood: `kube-proxy` sets up a bunch of `iptables` rules on our nodes

- Sometimes, it's the only available option for external traffic

  (e.g. most clusters deployed with kubeadm or on-premises)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Running containers with open ports

- Since `ping` doesn't have anything to connect to, we'll have to run something else

- We could use the `nginx` official image, but ...

  ... we wouldn't be able to tell the backends from each other!

- We are going to use `jpetazzo/color`, a tiny HTTP server written in Go

- `jpetazzo/color` listens on port 80

- It serves a page showing the pod's name

  (this will be useful when checking load balancing behavior)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Creating a deployment for our HTTP server

- We will create a deployment with `kubectl create deployment`

- Then we will scale it with `kubectl scale`

.lab[

- In another window, watch the pods (to see when they are created):
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -w
  ```

<!--
```wait NAME```
```tmux split-pane -h```
-->

- Create a deployment for this very lightweight HTTP server:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment blue --image=jpetazzo/color
  ```

- Scale it to 10 replicas:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment blue --replicas=10
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Exposing our deployment

- We'll create a default `ClusterIP` service

.lab[

- Expose the HTTP port of our server:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment blue --port=80
  ```

- Look up which IP address was allocated:
  ```bash
  kubectl get service
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Services are layer 4 constructs

- You can assign IP addresses to services, but they are still *layer 4*

  (i.e. a service is not an IP address; it's an IP address + protocol + port)

- This is caused by the current implementation of `kube-proxy`

  (it relies on mechanisms that don't support layer 3)

- As a result: you *have to* indicate the port number for your service
    
  (with some exceptions, like `ExternalName` or headless services, covered later)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Testing our service

- We will now send a few HTTP requests to our pods

.lab[

- Let's obtain the IP address that was allocated for our service, *programmatically:*
  ```bash
  IP=$(kubectl get svc blue -o go-template --template '{{ .spec.clusterIP }}')
  ```

<!--
```hide kubectl wait deploy blue --for condition=available```
```key ^D```
```key ^C```
-->

- Send a few requests:
  ```bash
  curl http://$IP:80/
  ```

]

--

Try it a few times! Our requests are load balanced across multiple pods.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## `ExternalName`

- Services of type `ExternalName` are quite different

- No load balancer (internal or external) is created

- Only a DNS entry gets added to the DNS managed by Kubernetes

- That DNS entry will just be a `CNAME` to a provided record

Example:
```bash
kubectl create service externalname k8s --external-name kubernetes.io
```
*Creates a CNAME `k8s` pointing to `kubernetes.io`*

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## External IPs

- We can add an External IP to a service, e.g.:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deploy my-little-deploy --port=80 --external-ip=1.2.3.4
  ```

- `1.2.3.4` should be the address of one of our nodes

  (it could also be a virtual address, service address, or VIP, shared by multiple nodes)

- Connections to `1.2.3.4:80` will be sent to our service

- External IPs will also show up on services of type `LoadBalancer`

  (they will be added automatically by the process provisioning the load balancer)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Headless services

- Sometimes, we want to access our scaled services directly:

  - if we want to save a tiny little bit of latency (typically less than 1ms)

  - if we need to connect over arbitrary ports (instead of a few fixed ones)

  - if we need to communicate over another protocol than UDP or TCP

  - if we want to decide how to balance the requests client-side

  - ...

- In that case, we can use a "headless service"

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Creating a headless services

- A headless service is obtained by setting the `clusterIP` field to `None`

  (Either with `--cluster-ip=None`, or by providing a custom YAML)

- As a result, the service doesn't have a virtual IP address

- Since there is no virtual IP address, there is no load balancer either

- CoreDNS will return the pods' IP addresses as multiple `A` records

- This gives us an easy way to discover all the replicas for a deployment

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Services and endpoints

- A service has a number of "endpoints"

- Each endpoint is a host + port where the service is available

- The endpoints are maintained and updated automatically by Kubernetes

.lab[

- Check the endpoints that Kubernetes has associated with our `blue` service:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe service blue
  ```

]

In the output, there will be a line starting with `Endpoints:`.

That line will list a bunch of addresses in `host:port` format.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Viewing endpoint details

- When we have many endpoints, our display commands truncate the list
  ```bash
  kubectl get endpoints
  ```

- If we want to see the full list, we can use one of the following commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe endpoints blue
  kubectl get endpoints blue -o yaml
  ```

- These commands will show us a list of IP addresses

- These IP addresses should match the addresses of the corresponding pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -l app=blue -o wide
  ```

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## `endpoints` not `endpoint`

- `endpoints` is the only resource that cannot be singular

```bash
$ kubectl get endpoint
error: the server doesn't have a resource type "endpoint"
```

- This is because the type itself is plural (unlike every other resource)

- There is no `endpoint` object: `type Endpoints struct`

- The type doesn't represent a single endpoint, but a list of endpoints

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The DNS zone

- In the `kube-system` namespace, there should be a service named `kube-dns`

- This is the internal DNS server that can resolve service names

- The default domain name for the service we created is `default.svc.cluster.local`

.lab[

- Get the IP address of the internal DNS server:
  ```bash

## `Ingress`

- Ingresses are another type (kind) of resource

- They are specifically for HTTP services

  (not TCP or UDP)

- They can also handle TLS certificates, URL rewriting ...

- They require an *Ingress Controller* to function

# Shipping images with a registry

- Initially, our app was running on a single node

- We could *build* and *run* in the same place

- Therefore, we did not need to *ship* anything

- Now that we want to run on a cluster, things are different

- The easiest way to ship container images is to use a registry

.debug[[k8s/shippingimages.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/shippingimages.md)]
---

## How Docker registries work (a reminder)

- What happens when we execute `docker run alpine` ?

- If the Engine needs to pull the `alpine` image, it expands it into `library/alpine`

- `library/alpine` is expanded into `index.docker.io/library/alpine`

- The Engine communicates with `index.docker.io` to retrieve `library/alpine:latest`

- To use something else than `index.docker.io`, we specify it in the image name

- Examples:
  ```bash
  docker pull gcr.io/google-containers/alpine-with-bash:1.0

  docker build -t registry.mycompany.io:5000/myimage:awesome .
  docker push registry.mycompany.io:5000/myimage:awesome
  ```

.debug[[k8s/shippingimages.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/shippingimages.md)]
---

## Running DockerCoins on Kubernetes

- Create one deployment for each component

  (hasher, redis, rng, webui, worker)

- Expose deployments that need to accept connections

  (hasher, redis, rng, webui)

- For redis, we can use the official redis image

- For the 4 others, we need to build images and push them to some registry

.debug[[k8s/shippingimages.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/shippingimages.md)]
---

## Building and shipping images

- There are *many* options!

- Manually:

  - build locally (with `docker build` or otherwise)

  - push to the registry

- Automatically:

  - build and test locally

  - when ready, commit and push a code repository

  - the code repository notifies an automated build system

  - that system gets the code, builds it, pushes the image to the registry

.debug[[k8s/shippingimages.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/shippingimages.md)]
---

## Which registry do we want to use?

- There are SAAS products like Docker Hub, Quay ...

- Each major cloud provider has an option as well

  (ACR on Azure, ECR on AWS, GCR on Google Cloud...)

- There are also commercial products to run our own registry

  (Docker EE, Quay...)

- And open source options, too!

- When picking a registry, pay attention to its build system

  (when it has one)

.debug[[k8s/shippingimages.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/shippingimages.md)]
---

## Building on the fly

- Conceptually, it is possible to build images on the fly from a repository

- Example: [ctr.run](https://ctr.run/)

  (deprecated in August 2020, after being aquired by Datadog)

- It did allow something like this:
  ```bash
  docker run ctr.run/github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/dockercoins/hasher
  ```

- No alternative yet

  (free startup idea, anyone?)

## Using images from the Docker Hub

- For everyone's convenience, we took care of building DockerCoins images

- We pushed these images to the DockerHub, under the [dockercoins](https://hub.docker.com/u/dockercoins) user

- These images are *tagged* with a version number, `v0.1`

- The full image names are therefore:

  - `dockercoins/hasher:v0.1`

  - `dockercoins/rng:v0.1`

  - `dockercoins/webui:v0.1`

  - `dockercoins/worker:v0.1`

# Running our application on Kubernetes

- We can now deploy our code (as well as a redis instance)

.lab[

- Deploy `redis`:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment redis --image=redis
  ```

- Deploy everything else:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment hasher --image=dockercoins/hasher:v0.1
  kubectl create deployment rng --image=dockercoins/rng:v0.1
  kubectl create deployment webui --image=dockercoins/webui:v0.1
  kubectl create deployment worker --image=dockercoins/worker:v0.1
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ourapponkube.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Deploying other images

- If we wanted to deploy images from another registry ...

- ... Or with a different tag ...

- ... We could use the following snippet:

```bash
  REGISTRY=dockercoins
  TAG=v0.1
  for SERVICE in hasher rng webui worker; do
    kubectl create deployment $SERVICE --image=$REGISTRY/$SERVICE:$TAG
  done
```

.debug[[k8s/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Is this working?

- After waiting for the deployment to complete, let's look at the logs!

  (Hint: use `kubectl get deploy -w` to watch deployment events)

.lab[

<!-- ```hide
kubectl wait deploy/rng --for condition=available
kubectl wait deploy/worker --for condition=available
``` -->

- Look at some logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/rng
  kubectl logs deploy/worker
  ```

]

--

ü§î `rng` is fine ... But not `worker`.

--

üí° Oh right! We forgot to `expose`.

.debug[[k8s/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Connecting containers together

- Three deployments need to be reachable by others: `hasher`, `redis`, `rng`

- `worker` doesn't need to be exposed

- `webui` will be dealt with later

.lab[

- Expose each deployment, specifying the right port:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment redis --port 6379
  kubectl expose deployment rng --port 80
  kubectl expose deployment hasher --port 80
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Is this working yet?

- The `worker` has an infinite loop, that retries 10 seconds after an error

.lab[

- Stream the worker's logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/worker --follow
  ```

  (Give it about 10 seconds to recover)

<!--
```wait units of work done, updating hash counter```
```key ^C```
-->

]

--

We should now see the `worker`, well, working happily.

.debug[[k8s/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Exposing services for external access

- Now we would like to access the Web UI

- We will expose it with a `NodePort`

  (just like we did for the registry)

.lab[

- Create a `NodePort` service for the Web UI:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deploy/webui --type=NodePort --port=80
  ```

- Check the port that was allocated:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Accessing the web UI

- We can now connect to *any node*, on the allocated node port, to view the web UI

.lab[

- Open the web UI in your browser (http://node-ip-address:3xxxx/)

<!-- ```open http://node1:3xxxx/``` -->

]

--

Yes, this may take a little while to update. *(Narrator: it was DNS.)*

--

*Alright, we're back to where we started, when we were running on a single node!*

# Deploying with YAML

- So far, we created resources with the following commands:

  - `kubectl run`

  - `kubectl create deployment`

  - `kubectl expose`

- We can also create resources directly with YAML manifests

.debug[[k8s/yamldeploy.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/yamldeploy.md)]
---

## `kubectl apply` vs `create`

- `kubectl create -f whatever.yaml`

  - creates resources if they don't exist

  - if resources already exist, don't alter them
    <br/>(and display error message)

- `kubectl apply -f whatever.yaml`

  - creates resources if they don't exist

  - if resources already exist, update them
    <br/>(to match the definition provided by the YAML file)

  - stores the manifest as an *annotation* in the resource

.debug[[k8s/yamldeploy.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/yamldeploy.md)]
---

## Creating multiple resources

- The manifest can contain multiple resources separated by `---`

```yaml
 kind: ...
 apiVersion: ...
 metadata: ...
   name: ...
 ...
 ---
 kind: ...
 apiVersion: ...
 metadata: ...
   name: ...
 ...
```

.debug[[k8s/yamldeploy.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/yamldeploy.md)]
---

## Creating multiple resources

- The manifest can also contain a list of resources

```yaml
 apiVersion: v1
 kind: List
 items:
 - kind: ...
   apiVersion: ...
   ...
 - kind: ...
   apiVersion: ...
   ...
```

.debug[[k8s/yamldeploy.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/yamldeploy.md)]
---

## Deploying dockercoins with YAML

- We provide a YAML manifest with all the resources for Dockercoins

  (Deployments and Services)

- We can use it if we need to deploy or redeploy Dockercoins

.lab[

- Deploy or redeploy Dockercoins:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/dockercoins.yaml
  ```

]

(If we deployed Dockercoins earlier, we will see warning messages,
because the resources that we created lack the necessary annotation.
We can safely ignore them.)

.debug[[k8s/yamldeploy.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/yamldeploy.md)]
---

## Deleting resources

- We can also use a YAML file to *delete* resources

- `kubectl delete -f ...` will delete all the resources mentioned in a YAML file

  (useful to clean up everything that was created by `kubectl apply -f ...`)

- The definitions of the resources don't matter

  (just their `kind`, `apiVersion`, and `name`)

.debug[[k8s/yamldeploy.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/yamldeploy.md)]
---

## Pruning¬π resources

- We can also tell `kubectl` to remove old resources

- This is done with `kubectl apply -f ... --prune`

- It will remove resources that don't exist in the YAML file(s)

- But only if they were created with `kubectl apply` in the first place

  (technically, if they have an annotation `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration`)

.footnote[¬πIf English is not your first language: *to prune* means to remove dead or overgrown branches in a tree, to help it to grow.]

.debug[[k8s/yamldeploy.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/yamldeploy.md)]
---

## YAML as source of truth

- Imagine the following workflow:

  - do not use `kubectl run`, `kubectl create deployment`, `kubectl expose` ...

  - define everything with YAML

  - `kubectl apply -f ... --prune --all` that YAML

  - keep that YAML under version control

  - enforce all changes to go through that YAML (e.g. with pull requests)

- Our version control system now has a full history of what we deploy

- Compares to "Infrastructure-as-Code", but for app deployments

.debug[[k8s/yamldeploy.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/yamldeploy.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Specifying the namespace

- When creating resources from YAML manifests, the namespace is optional

- If we specify a namespace:

  - resources are created in the specified namespace

  - this is typical for things deployed only once per cluster

  - example: system components, cluster add-ons ...

- If we don't specify a namespace:

  - resources are created in the current namespace

  - this is typical for things that may be deployed multiple times

  - example: applications (production, staging, feature branches ...)

# Setting up Kubernetes

- Kubernetes is made of many components that require careful configuration

- Secure operation typically requires TLS certificates and a local CA

  (certificate authority)

- Setting up everything manually is possible, but rarely done

  (except for learning purposes)

- Let's do a quick overview of available options!

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## Local development

- Are you writing code that will eventually run on Kubernetes?

- Then it's a good idea to have a development cluster!

- Instead of shipping containers images, we can test them on Kubernetes

- Extremely useful when authoring or testing Kubernetes-specific objects

  (ConfigMaps, Secrets, StatefulSets, Jobs, RBAC, etc.)

- Extremely convenient to quickly test/check what a particular thing looks like

  (e.g. what are the fields a Deployment spec?)

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## One-node clusters

- It's perfectly fine to work with a cluster that has only one node

- It simplifies a lot of things:

  - pod networking doesn't even need CNI plugins, overlay networks, etc.

  - these clusters can be fully contained (no pun intended) in an easy-to-ship VM or container image

  - some of the security aspects may be simplified (different threat model)

  - images can be built directly on the node (we don't need to ship them with a registry)

- Examples: Docker Desktop, k3d, KinD, MicroK8s, Minikube

  (some of these also support clusters with multiple nodes)

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## Managed clusters ("Turnkey Solutions")

- Many cloud providers and hosting providers offer "managed Kubernetes"

- The deployment and maintenance of the *control plane* is entirely managed by the provider

  (ideally, clusters can be spun up automatically through an API, CLI, or web interface)

- Given the complexity of Kubernetes, this approach is *strongly recommended*

  (at least for your first production clusters)

- After working for a while with Kubernetes, you will be better equipped to decide:

  - whether to operate it yourself or use a managed offering

  - which offering or which distribution works best for you and your needs

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## Node management

- Most "Turnkey Solutions" offer fully managed control planes

  (including control plane upgrades, sometimes done automatically)

- However, with most providers, we still need to take care of *nodes*

  (provisioning, upgrading, scaling the nodes)

- Example with Amazon EKS ["managed node groups"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html):

  *...when bugs or issues are reported [...] you're responsible for deploying these patched AMI versions to your managed node groups.*

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## Managed clusters differences

- Most providers let you pick which Kubernetes version you want

  - some providers offer up-to-date versions

  - others lag significantly (sometimes by 2 or 3 minor versions)

- Some providers offer multiple networking or storage options

- Others will only support one, tied to their infrastructure

  (changing that is in theory possible, but might be complex or unsupported)

- Some providers let you configure or customize the control plane

  (generally through Kubernetes "feature gates")

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## Choosing a provider

- Pricing models differ from one provider to another

  - nodes are generally charged at their usual price

  - control plane may be free or incur a small nominal fee

- Beyond pricing, there are *huge* differences in features between providers

- The "major" providers are not always the best ones!

- See [this page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/turnkey-solutions/) for a list of available providers

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## Kubernetes distributions and installers

- If you want to run Kubernetes yourselves, there are many options

  (free, commercial, proprietary, open source ...)

- Some of them are installers, while some are complete platforms

- Some of them leverage other well-known deployment tools

  (like Puppet, Terraform ...)

- There are too many options to list them all

  (check [this page](https://kubernetes.io/partners/#conformance) for an overview!)

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## kubeadm

- kubeadm is a tool part of Kubernetes to facilitate cluster setup

- Many other installers and distributions use it (but not all of them)

- It can also be used by itself

- Excellent starting point to install Kubernetes on your own machines

  (virtual, physical, it doesn't matter)

- It even supports highly available control planes, or "multi-master"

  (this is more complex, though, because it introduces the need for an API load balancer)

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## Manual setup

- The resources below are mainly for educational purposes!

- [Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) by Kelsey Hightower

  - step by step guide to install Kubernetes on Google Cloud

  - covers certificates, high availability ...

  - *‚ÄúKubernetes The Hard Way is optimized for learning, which means taking the long route to ensure you understand each task required to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster.‚Äù*

- [Deep Dive into Kubernetes Internals for Builders and Operators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KtEAa7_duA)

  - conference presentation showing step-by-step control plane setup

  - emphasis on simplicity, not on security and availability

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## About our training clusters

- How did we set up these Kubernetes clusters that we're using?

--

- We used `kubeadm` on freshly installed VM instances running Ubuntu LTS

    1. Install Docker

    2. Install Kubernetes packages

    3. Run `kubeadm init` on the first node (it deploys the control plane on that node)

    4. Set up  Weave (the overlay network) with a single `kubectl apply` command

    5. Run `kubeadm join` on the other nodes (with the token produced by `kubeadm init`)

    6. Copy the configuration file generated by `kubeadm init`

- Check the [prepare VMs README](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/prepare-vms/README.md) for more details

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## `kubeadm` "drawbacks"

- Doesn't set up Docker or any other container engine

  (this is by design, to give us choice)

- Doesn't set up the overlay network

  (this is also by design, for the same reasons)

- HA control plane requires [some extra steps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/high-availability/)

- Note that HA control plane also requires setting up a specific API load balancer

  (which is beyond the scope of kubeadm)

# Running a local development cluster

- Let's review some options to run Kubernetes locally

- There is no "best option", it depends what you value:

  - ability to run on all platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows, other?)

  - ability to run clusters with multiple nodes

  - ability to run multiple clusters side by side

  - ability to run recent (or even, unreleased) versions of Kubernetes

  - availability of plugins

  - etc.

.debug[[k8s/setup-devel.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-devel.md)]
---

## Docker Desktop

- Available on Mac and Windows

- Gives you one cluster with one node

- Very easy to use if you are already using Docker Desktop:

  go to Docker Desktop preferences and enable Kubernetes

- Ideal for Docker users who need good integration between both platforms

.debug[[k8s/setup-devel.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-devel.md)]
---

## [k3d](https://k3d.io/)

- Based on [K3s](https://k3s.io/) by Rancher Labs

- Requires Docker

- Runs Kubernetes nodes in Docker containers

- Can deploy multiple clusters, with multiple nodes, and multiple master nodes

- As of June 2020, two versions co-exist: stable (1.7) and beta (3.0)

- They have different syntax and options, this can be confusing

  (but don't let that stop you!)

.debug[[k8s/setup-devel.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-devel.md)]
---

## k3d in action

- Install `k3d` (e.g. get the binary from https://github.com/rancher/k3d/releases)

- Create a simple cluster:
  ```bash
  k3d cluster create petitcluster
  ```

- Create a more complex cluster with a custom version:
  ```bash
  k3d cluster create groscluster \
        --image rancher/k3s:v1.18.9-k3s1 --servers 3 --agents 5
  ```

  (3 nodes for the control plane + 5 worker nodes)
 
- Clusters are automatically added to `.kube/config` file

.debug[[k8s/setup-devel.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-devel.md)]
---

## [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)

- Kubernetes-in-Docker

- Requires Docker (obviously!)

- Deploying a single node cluster using the latest version is simple:
  ```bash
  kind create cluster
  ```

- More advanced scenarios require writing a short [config file](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start#configuring-your-kind-cluster)

  (to define multiple nodes, multiple master nodes, set Kubernetes versions ...)
 
- Can deploy multiple clusters

.debug[[k8s/setup-devel.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-devel.md)]
---

## [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)

- The "legacy" option!

  (note: this is not a bad thing, it means that it's very stable, has lots of plugins, etc.)

- Supports many [drivers](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/)

  (HyperKit, Hyper-V, KVM, VirtualBox, but also Docker and many others)

- Can deploy a single cluster; recent versions can deploy multiple nodes

- Great option if you want a "Kubernetes first" experience

  (i.e. if you don't already have Docker and/or don't want/need it)

.debug[[k8s/setup-devel.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-devel.md)]
---

## [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/)

- Available on Linux, and since recently, on Mac and Windows as well

- The Linux version is installed through Snap

  (which is pre-installed on all recent versions of Ubuntu)

- Also supports clustering (as in, multiple machines running MicroK8s)

- DNS is not enabled by default; enable it with `microk8s enable dns`

.debug[[k8s/setup-devel.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-devel.md)]
---

## [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/)

- Available on Mac and Windows

- Runs a single cluster with a single node

- Lets you pick the Kubernetes version that you want to use

  (and change it any time you like)

- Emphasis on ease of use (like Docker Desktop)

- Very young product (first release in May 2021)

- Based on k3s and other proven components

.debug[[k8s/setup-devel.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/setup-devel.md)]
---

## VM with custom install

- Choose your own adventure!

- Pick any Linux distribution!

- Build your cluster from scratch or use a Kubernetes installer!

- Discover exotic CNI plugins and container runtimes!

- The only limit is yourself, and the time you are willing to sink in!

# The Kubernetes dashboard

- Kubernetes resources can also be viewed with a web dashboard

- Dashboard users need to authenticate

  (typically with a token)

- The dashboard should be exposed over HTTPS

  (to prevent interception of the aforementioned token)

- Ideally, this requires obtaining a proper TLS certificate

  (for instance, with Let's Encrypt)

.debug[[k8s/dashboard.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/dashboard.md)]
---

## Three ways to install the dashboard

- Our `k8s` directory has no less than three manifests!

- `dashboard-recommended.yaml`

  (purely internal dashboard; user must be created manually)

- `dashboard-with-token.yaml`

  (dashboard exposed with NodePort; creates an admin user for us)

- `dashboard-insecure.yaml` aka *YOLO*

  (dashboard exposed over HTTP; gives root access to anonymous users)

.debug[[k8s/dashboard.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/dashboard.md)]
---

## `dashboard-insecure.yaml`

- This will allow anyone to deploy anything on your cluster

  (without any authentication whatsoever)

- **Do not** use this, except maybe on a local cluster

  (or a cluster that you will destroy a few minutes later)

- On "normal" clusters, use `dashboard-with-token.yaml` instead!

.debug[[k8s/dashboard.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/dashboard.md)]
---

## What's in the manifest?

- The dashboard itself

- An HTTP/HTTPS unwrapper (using `socat`)

- The guest/admin account

.lab[

- Create all the dashboard resources, with the following command:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/dashboard-insecure.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/dashboard.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/dashboard.md)]
---

## Connecting to the dashboard

.lab[

- Check which port the dashboard is on:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc dashboard
  ```

]

You'll want the `3xxxx` port.


.lab[

- Connect to http://oneofournodes:3xxxx/

<!-- ```open http://node1:3xxxx/``` -->

]

The dashboard will then ask you which authentication you want to use.

.debug[[k8s/dashboard.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/dashboard.md)]
---

## Dashboard authentication

- We have three authentication options at this point:

  - token (associated with a role that has appropriate permissions)

  - kubeconfig (e.g. using the `~/.kube/config` file from `node1`)

  - "skip" (use the dashboard "service account")

- Let's use "skip": we're logged in!

--

.warning[Remember, we just added a backdoor to our Kubernetes cluster!]

.debug[[k8s/dashboard.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/dashboard.md)]
---

## Closing the backdoor

- Seriously, don't leave that thing running!

.lab[

- Remove what we just created:
  ```bash
    kubectl delete -f ~/container.training/k8s/dashboard-insecure.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/dashboard.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/dashboard.md)]
---

## The risks

- The steps that we just showed you are *for educational purposes only!*

- If you do that on your production cluster, people [can and will abuse it](https://redlock.io/blog/cryptojacking-tesla)

- For an in-depth discussion about securing the dashboard,
  <br/>
  check [this excellent post on Heptio's blog](https://blog.heptio.com/on-securing-the-kubernetes-dashboard-16b09b1b7aca)

.debug[[k8s/dashboard.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/dashboard.md)]
---

## `dashboard-with-token.yaml`

- This is a less risky way to deploy the dashboard

- It's not completely secure, either:

  - we're using a self-signed certificate

  - this is subject to eavesdropping attacks

- Using `kubectl port-forward` or `kubectl proxy` is even better

.debug[[k8s/dashboard.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/dashboard.md)]
---

## What's in the manifest?

- The dashboard itself (but exposed with a `NodePort`)

- A ServiceAccount with `cluster-admin` privileges

  (named `kubernetes-dashboard:cluster-admin`)

.lab[

- Create all the dashboard resources, with the following command:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/dashboard-with-token.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/dashboard.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/dashboard.md)]
---

## Obtaining the token

- The manifest creates a ServiceAccount

- Kubernetes will automatically generate a token for that ServiceAccount

.lab[

- Display the token:
  ```bash
    kubectl --namespace=kubernetes-dashboard \
      describe secret cluster-admin-token
  ```

]

The token should start with `eyJ...` (it's a JSON Web Token).

Note that the secret name will actually be `cluster-admin-token-xxxxx`.
<br/>
(But `kubectl` prefix matches are great!)

.debug[[k8s/dashboard.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/dashboard.md)]
---

## Connecting to the dashboard

.lab[

- Check which port the dashboard is on:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc --namespace=kubernetes-dashboard
  ```

]

You'll want the `3xxxx` port.


.lab[

- Connect to http://oneofournodes:3xxxx/

<!-- ```open http://node1:3xxxx/``` -->

]

The dashboard will then ask you which authentication you want to use.

.debug[[k8s/dashboard.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/dashboard.md)]
---

## Dashboard authentication

- Select "token" authentication

- Copy paste the token (starting with `eyJ...`) obtained earlier

- We're logged in!

.debug[[k8s/dashboard.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/dashboard.md)]
---

## Other dashboards

- [Kube Web View](https://codeberg.org/hjacobs/kube-web-view)

  - read-only dashboard

  - optimized for "troubleshooting and incident response"

  - see [vision and goals](https://kube-web-view.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vision.html#vision) for details

- [Kube Ops View](https://codeberg.org/hjacobs/kube-ops-view)

  - "provides a common operational picture for multiple Kubernetes clusters"

# k9s

- Somewhere in between CLI and GUI (or web UI), we can find the magic land of TUI

  - [Text-based user interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface)

  - often using libraries like [curses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_%28programming_library%29) and its successors

- Some folks love them, some folks hate them, some are indifferent ...

- But it's nice to have different options!

- Let's see one particular TUI for Kubernetes: [k9s](https://k9scli.io/)

.debug[[k8s/k9s.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/k9s.md)]
---

## Installing k9s

- If you are using a training cluster or the [shpod](https://github.com/jpetazzo/shpod) image, k9s is pre-installed

- Otherwise, it can be installed easily:

  - with [various package managers](https://k9scli.io/topics/install/)

  - or by fetching a [binary release](https://github.com/derailed/k9s/releases)

- We don't need to set up or configure anything

  (it will use the same configuration as `kubectl` and other well-behaved clients)

- Just run `k9s` to fire it up!

.debug[[k8s/k9s.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/k9s.md)]
---

## What kind to we want to see?

- Press `:` to change the type of resource to view

- Then type, for instance, `ns` or `namespace` or `nam[TAB]`, then `[ENTER]`

- Use the arrows to move down to e.g. `kube-system`, and press `[ENTER]`

- Or, type `/kub` or `/sys` to filter the output, and press `[ENTER]` twice

  (once to exit the filter, once to enter the namespace)

- We now see the pods in `kube-system`!

.debug[[k8s/k9s.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/k9s.md)]
---

## Interacting with pods

- `l` to view logs

- `d` to describe

- `s` to get a shell (won't work if `sh` isn't available in the container image)

- `e` to edit

- `shift-f` to define port forwarding

- `ctrl-k` to kill

- `[ESC]` to get out or get back

.debug[[k8s/k9s.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/k9s.md)]
---

## Quick navigation between namespaces

- On top of the screen, we should see shortcuts like this:
  ```
  <0> all
  <1> kube-system
  <2> default
  ```

- Pressing the corresponding number switches to that namespace

  (or shows resources across all namespaces with `0`)

- Locate a namespace with a copy of DockerCoins, and go there!

.debug[[k8s/k9s.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/k9s.md)]
---

## Interacting with Deployments

- View Deployments (type `:` `deploy` `[ENTER]`)

- Select e.g. `worker`

- Scale it with `s`

- View its aggregated logs with `l`

.debug[[k8s/k9s.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/k9s.md)]
---

## Exit

- Exit at any time with `Ctrl-C`

- k9s will "remember" where you were

  (and go back there next time you run it)

.debug[[k8s/k9s.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/k9s.md)]
---

## Pros

- Very convenient to navigate through resources

  (hopping from a deployment, to its pod, to another namespace, etc.)

- Very convenient to quickly view logs of e.g. init containers

- Very convenient to get a (quasi) realtime view of resources

  (if we use `watch kubectl get` a lot, we will probably like k9s)

.debug[[k8s/k9s.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/k9s.md)]
---

## Cons

- Doesn't promote automation / scripting

  (if you repeat the same things over and over, there is a scripting opportunity)

- Not all features are available

  (e.g. executing arbitrary commands in containers)

.debug[[k8s/k9s.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/k9s.md)]
---

## Conclusion

Try it out, and see if it makes you more productive!

# Scaling our demo app

- Our ultimate goal is to get more DockerCoins

  (i.e. increase the number of loops per second shown on the web UI)

- Let's look at the architecture again:

  ![DockerCoins architecture](images/dockercoins-diagram.png)

- The loop is done in the worker;
  perhaps we could try adding more workers?

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Adding another worker

- All we have to do is scale the `worker` Deployment

.lab[

- Open a new terminal to keep an eye on our pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -w
  ```

<!--
```wait RESTARTS```
```tmux split-pane -h```
-->

- Now, create more `worker` replicas:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment worker --replicas=2
  ```

]

After a few seconds, the graph in the web UI should show up.

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Adding more workers

- If 2 workers give us 2x speed, what about 3 workers?

.lab[

- Scale the `worker` Deployment further:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment worker --replicas=3
  ```

]

The graph in the web UI should go up again.

(This is looking great! We're gonna be RICH!)

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Adding even more workers

- Let's see if 10 workers give us 10x speed!

.lab[

- Scale the `worker` Deployment to a bigger number:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment worker --replicas=10
  ```

<!--
```key ^D```
```key ^C```
-->

]

--

The graph will peak at 10 hashes/second.

(We can add as many workers as we want: we will never go past 10 hashes/second.)

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Didn't we briefly exceed 10 hashes/second?

- It may *look like it*, because the web UI shows instant speed

- The instant speed can briefly exceed 10 hashes/second

- The average speed cannot

- The instant speed can be biased because of how it's computed

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Why instant speed is misleading

- The instant speed is computed client-side by the web UI

- The web UI checks the hash counter once per second
  <br/>
  (and does a classic (h2-h1)/(t2-t1) speed computation)

- The counter is updated once per second by the workers

- These timings are not exact
  <br/>
  (e.g. the web UI check interval is client-side JavaScript)

- Sometimes, between two web UI counter measurements,
  <br/>
  the workers are able to update the counter *twice*

- During that cycle, the instant speed will appear to be much bigger
  <br/>
  (but it will be compensated by lower instant speed before and after)

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Why are we stuck at 10 hashes per second?

- If this was high-quality, production code, we would have instrumentation

  (Datadog, Honeycomb, New Relic, statsd, Sumologic, ...)

- It's not!

- Perhaps we could benchmark our web services?

  (with tools like `ab`, or even simpler, `httping`)

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Benchmarking our web services

- We want to check `hasher` and `rng`

- We are going to use `httping`

- It's just like `ping`, but using HTTP `GET` requests

  (it measures how long it takes to perform one `GET` request)

- It's used like this:
  ```
  httping [-c count] http://host:port/path
  ```

- Or even simpler:
  ```
  httping ip.ad.dr.ess
  ```

- We will use `httping` on the ClusterIP addresses of our services

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Obtaining ClusterIP addresses

- We can simply check the output of `kubectl get services`

- Or do it programmatically, as in the example below

.lab[

- Retrieve the IP addresses:
  ```bash
  HASHER=$(kubectl get svc hasher -o go-template={{.spec.clusterIP}})
  RNG=$(kubectl get svc rng -o go-template={{.spec.clusterIP}})
  ```

]

Now we can access the IP addresses of our services through `$HASHER` and `$RNG`.

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Checking `hasher` and `rng` response times

.lab[

- Check the response times for both services:
  ```bash
  httping -c 3 $HASHER
  httping -c 3 $RNG
  ```

]

- `hasher` is fine (it should take a few milliseconds to reply)

- `rng` is not (it should take about 700 milliseconds if there are 10 workers)

- Something is wrong with `rng`, but ... what?

---
## Let's draw hasty conclusions

- The bottleneck seems to be `rng`

- *What if* we don't have enough entropy and can't generate enough random numbers?

- We need to scale out the `rng` service on multiple machines!

Note: this is a fiction! We have enough entropy. But we need a pretext to scale out.

(In fact, the code of `rng` uses `/dev/urandom`, which never runs out of entropy...
<br/>
...and is [just as good as `/dev/random`](http://www.slideshare.net/PacSecJP/filippo-plain-simple-reality-of-entropy).)

# Daemon sets

- We want to scale `rng` in a way that is different from how we scaled `worker`

- We want one (and exactly one) instance of `rng` per node

- We *do not want* two instances of `rng` on the same node

- We will do that with a *daemon set*

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Why not a deployment?

- Can't we just do `kubectl scale deployment rng --replicas=...`?

--

- Nothing guarantees that the `rng` containers will be distributed evenly

- If we add nodes later, they will not automatically run a copy of `rng`

- If we remove (or reboot) a node, one `rng` container will restart elsewhere

  (and we will end up with two instances `rng` on the same node)

- By contrast, a daemon set will start one pod per node and keep it that way

  (as nodes are added or removed)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Daemon sets in practice

- Daemon sets are great for cluster-wide, per-node processes:

  - `kube-proxy`

  - `weave` (our overlay network)

  - monitoring agents

  - hardware management tools (e.g. SCSI/FC HBA agents)

  - etc.

- They can also be restricted to run [only on some nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/#running-pods-on-only-some-nodes)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Creating a daemon set

<!-- ##VERSION## -->

- Unfortunately, as of Kubernetes 1.19, the CLI cannot create daemon sets

--

- More precisely: it doesn't have a subcommand to create a daemon set

--

- But any kind of resource can always be created by providing a YAML description:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f foo.yaml
  ```

--

- How do we create the YAML file for our daemon set?

--

  - option 1: [read the docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/#create-a-daemonset)

--

  - option 2: `vi` our way out of it

## Creating the YAML file for our daemon set

- Let's start with the YAML file for the current `rng` resource

.lab[

- Dump the `rng` resource in YAML:
  ```bash
  kubectl get deploy/rng -o yaml >rng.yml
  ```

- Edit `rng.yml`

]

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## "Casting" a resource to another

- What if we just changed the `kind` field?

  (It can't be that easy, right?)

.lab[

- Change `kind: Deployment` to `kind: DaemonSet`

<!--
```bash vim rng.yml```
```wait kind: Deployment```
```keys /Deployment```
```key ^J```
```keys cwDaemonSet```
```key ^[``` ]
```keys :wq```
```key ^J```
-->

- Save, quit

- Try to create our new resource:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f rng.yml
  ```

<!-- ```wait error:``` -->

]

--

We all knew this couldn't be that easy, right!

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Understanding the problem

- The core of the error is:
  ```
  error validating data:
  [ValidationError(DaemonSet.spec):
  unknown field "replicas" in io.k8s.api.extensions.v1beta1.DaemonSetSpec,
  ...
  ```

--

- *Obviously,* it doesn't make sense to specify a number of replicas for a daemon set

--

- Workaround: fix the YAML

  - remove the `replicas` field
  - remove the `strategy` field (which defines the rollout mechanism for a deployment)
  - remove the `progressDeadlineSeconds` field (also used by the rollout mechanism)
  - remove the `status: {}` line at the end

--

- Or, we could also ...

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Use the `--force`, Luke

- We could also tell Kubernetes to ignore these errors and try anyway

- The `--force` flag's actual name is `--validate=false`

.lab[

- Try to load our YAML file and ignore errors:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f rng.yml --validate=false
  ```

]

--

üé©‚ú®üêá

--

Wait ... Now, can it be *that* easy?

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Checking what we've done

- Did we transform our `deployment` into a `daemonset`?

.lab[

- Look at the resources that we have now:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

--

We have two resources called `rng`:

- the *deployment* that was existing before

- the *daemon set* that we just created

We also have one too many pods.
<br/>
(The pod corresponding to the *deployment* still exists.)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## `deploy/rng` and `ds/rng`

- You can have different resource types with the same name

  (i.e. a *deployment* and a *daemon set* both named `rng`)

- We still have the old `rng` *deployment*

  ```
NAME                       DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/rng        1         1         1            1           18m
  ```

- But now we have the new `rng` *daemon set* as well

  ```
NAME                DESIRED  CURRENT  READY  UP-TO-DATE  AVAILABLE  NODE SELECTOR  AGE
daemonset.apps/rng  2        2        2      2           2          <none>         9s
  ```

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Too many pods

- If we check with `kubectl get pods`, we see:

  - *one pod* for the deployment (named `rng-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy`)

  - *one pod per node* for the daemon set (named `rng-zzzzz`)

  ```
  NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  rng-54f57d4d49-7pt82        1/1       Running   0          11m
  rng-b85tm                   1/1       Running   0          25s
  rng-hfbrr                   1/1       Running   0          25s
  [...]
  ```

--

The daemon set created one pod per node, except on the master node.

The master node has [taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/) preventing pods from running there.

(To schedule a pod on this node anyway, the pod will require appropriate [tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/).)

.footnote[(Off by one? We don't run these pods on the node hosting the control plane.)]

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Is this working?

- Look at the web UI

--

- The graph should now go above 10 hashes per second!

--

- It looks like the newly created pods are serving traffic correctly

- How and why did this happen?

  (We didn't do anything special to add them to the `rng` service load balancer!)

# Labels and selectors

- The `rng` *service* is load balancing requests to a set of pods

- That set of pods is defined by the *selector* of the `rng` service

.lab[

- Check the *selector* in the `rng` service definition:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe service rng
  ```

]

- The selector is `app=rng`

- It means "all the pods having the label `app=rng`"

  (They can have additional labels as well, that's OK!)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Selector evaluation

- We can use selectors with many `kubectl` commands

- For instance, with `kubectl get`, `kubectl logs`, `kubectl delete` ... and more

.lab[

- Get the list of pods matching selector `app=rng`:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -l app=rng
  kubectl get pods --selector app=rng
  ```

]

But ... why do these pods (in particular, the *new* ones) have this `app=rng` label?

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Where do labels come from?

- When we create a deployment with `kubectl create deployment rng`,
  <br/>this deployment gets the label `app=rng`

- The replica sets created by this deployment also get the label `app=rng`

- The pods created by these replica sets also get the label `app=rng`

- When we created the daemon set from the deployment, we re-used the same spec

- Therefore, the pods created by the daemon set get the same labels

.footnote[Note: when we use `kubectl run stuff`, the label is `run=stuff` instead.]

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Updating load balancer configuration

- We would like to remove a pod from the load balancer

- What would happen if we removed that pod, with `kubectl delete pod ...`?

--

  It would be re-created immediately (by the replica set or the daemon set)

--

- What would happen if we removed the `app=rng` label from that pod?

--

  It would *also* be re-created immediately

--

  Why?!?

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Selectors for replica sets and daemon sets

- The "mission" of a replica set is:

  "Make sure that there is the right number of pods matching this spec!"

- The "mission" of a daemon set is:

  "Make sure that there is a pod matching this spec on each node!"

--

- *In fact,* replica sets and daemon sets do not check pod specifications

- They merely have a *selector*, and they look for pods matching that selector

- Yes, we can fool them by manually creating pods with the "right" labels

- Bottom line: if we remove our `app=rng` label ...

 ... The pod "disappears" for its parent, which re-creates another pod to replace it

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Isolation of replica sets and daemon sets

- Since both the `rng` daemon set and the `rng` replica set use `app=rng` ...

  ... Why don't they "find" each other's pods?

--

- *Replica sets* have a more specific selector, visible with `kubectl describe`

  (It looks like `app=rng,pod-template-hash=abcd1234`)

- *Daemon sets* also have a more specific selector, but it's invisible

  (It looks like `app=rng,controller-revision-hash=abcd1234`)

- As a result, each controller only "sees" the pods it manages

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Removing a pod from the load balancer

- Currently, the `rng` service is defined by the `app=rng` selector

- The only way to remove a pod is to remove or change the `app` label

- ... But that will cause another pod to be created instead!

- What's the solution?

--

- We need to change the selector of the `rng` service!

- Let's add another label to that selector (e.g. `active=yes`) 

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Selectors with multiple labels

- If a selector specifies multiple labels, they are understood as a logical *AND*

  (in other words: the pods must match all the labels)

- We cannot have a logical *OR*

  (e.g. `app=api AND (release=prod OR release=preprod)`)

- We can, however, apply as many extra labels as we want to our pods:

  - use selector `app=api AND prod-or-preprod=yes`

  - add `prod-or-preprod=yes` to both sets of pods

- We will see later that in other places, we can use more advanced selectors

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## The plan

1. Add the label `active=yes` to all our `rng` pods

2. Update the selector for the `rng` service to also include `active=yes`

3. Toggle traffic to a pod by manually adding/removing the `active` label

4. Profit!

*Note: if we swap steps 1 and 2, it will cause a short
service disruption, because there will be a period of time
during which the service selector won't match any pod.
During that time, requests to the service will time out.
By doing things in the order above, we guarantee that there won't
be any interruption.*

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Adding labels to pods

- We want to add the label `active=yes` to all pods that have `app=rng`

- We could edit each pod one by one with `kubectl edit` ...

- ... Or we could use `kubectl label` to label them all

- `kubectl label` can use selectors itself

.lab[

- Add `active=yes` to all pods that have `app=rng`:
  ```bash
  kubectl label pods -l app=rng active=yes
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Updating the service selector

- We need to edit the service specification

- Reminder: in the service definition, we will see `app: rng` in two places

  - the label of the service itself (we don't need to touch that one)

  - the selector of the service (that's the one we want to change)

.lab[

- Update the service to add `active: yes` to its selector:
  ```bash
  kubectl edit service rng
  ```

<!--
```wait Please edit the object below```
```keys /app: rng```
```key ^J```
```keys noactive: yes```
```key ^[``` ]
```keys :wq```
```key ^J```
-->

]

--

... And then we get *the weirdest error ever.* Why?

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## When the YAML parser is being too smart

- YAML parsers try to help us:

  - `xyz` is the string `"xyz"`

  - `42` is the integer `42`

  - `yes` is the boolean value `true`

- If we want the string `"42"` or the string `"yes"`, we have to quote them

- So we have to use `active: "yes"`

.footnote[For a good laugh: if we had used "ja", "oui", "si" ... as the value, it would have worked!]

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Updating the service selector, take 2

.lab[

- Update the YAML manifest of the service

- Add `active: "yes"` to its selector

<!--
```wait Please edit the object below```
```keys /yes```
```key ^J```
```keys cw"yes"```
```key ^[``` ]
```keys :wq```
```key ^J```
-->

]

This time it should work!

If we did everything correctly, the web UI shouldn't show any change.

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Updating labels

- We want to disable the pod that was created by the deployment

- All we have to do, is remove the `active` label from that pod

- To identify that pod, we can use its name

- ... Or rely on the fact that it's the only one with a `pod-template-hash` label

- Good to know:

  - `kubectl label ... foo=` doesn't remove a label (it sets it to an empty string)

  - to remove label `foo`, use `kubectl label ... foo-`

  - to change an existing label, we would need to add `--overwrite`

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Removing a pod from the load balancer

.lab[

- In one window, check the logs of that pod:
  ```bash
  POD=$(kubectl get pod -l app=rng,pod-template-hash -o name)
  kubectl logs --tail 1 --follow $POD
  ```
  (We should see a steady stream of HTTP logs)

<!--
```wait HTTP/1.1```
```tmux split-pane -v```
-->

- In another window, remove the label from the pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl label pod -l app=rng,pod-template-hash active-
  ```
  (The stream of HTTP logs should stop immediately)

<!--
```key ^D```
```key ^C```
-->

]

There might be a slight change in the web UI (since we removed a bit
of capacity from the `rng` service). If we remove more pods,
the effect should be more visible.

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Updating the daemon set

- If we scale up our cluster by adding new nodes, the daemon set will create more pods

- These pods won't have the `active=yes` label

- If we want these pods to have that label, we need to edit the daemon set spec

- We can do that with e.g. `kubectl edit daemonset rng`

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## We've put resources in your resources

- Reminder: a daemon set is a resource that creates more resources!

- There is a difference between:

  - the label(s) of a resource (in the `metadata` block in the beginning)

  - the selector of a resource (in the `spec` block)

  - the label(s) of the resource(s) created by the first resource (in the `template` block)

- We would need to update the selector and the template

  (metadata labels are not mandatory)

- The template must match the selector

  (i.e. the resource will refuse to create resources that it will not select)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Labels and debugging

- When a pod is misbehaving, we can delete it: another one will be recreated

- But we can also change its labels

- It will be removed from the load balancer (it won't receive traffic anymore)

- Another pod will be recreated immediately

- But the problematic pod is still here, and we can inspect and debug it

- We can even re-add it to the rotation if necessary

  (Very useful to troubleshoot intermittent and elusive bugs)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Labels and advanced rollout control

- Conversely, we can add pods matching a service's selector

- These pods will then receive requests and serve traffic

- Examples:

  - one-shot pod with all debug flags enabled, to collect logs

  - pods created automatically, but added to rotation in a second step
    <br/>
    (by setting their label accordingly)

- This gives us building blocks for canary and blue/green deployments

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Advanced label selectors

- As indicated earlier, service selectors are limited to a `AND`

- But in many other places in the Kubernetes API, we can use complex selectors

  (e.g. Deployment, ReplicaSet, DaemonSet, NetworkPolicy ...)

- These allow extra operations; specifically:

  - checking for presence (or absence) of a label

  - checking if a label is (or is not) in a given set

- Relevant documentation:

  [Service spec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#servicespec-v1-core),
  [LabelSelector spec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#labelselector-v1-meta),
  [label selector doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Example of advanced selector

```yaml
  theSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: portal
      component: api
    matchExpressions:
    - key: release
      operator: In
      values: [ production, preproduction ]
    - key: signed-off-by
      operator: Exists
```

This selector matches pods that meet *all* the indicated conditions.

`operator` can be `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, `DoesNotExist`.

A `nil` selector matches *nothing*, a `{}` selector matches *everything*.
<br/>
(Because that means "match all pods that meet at least zero condition".)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Services and Endpoints

- Each Service has a corresponding Endpoints resource

  (see `kubectl get endpoints` or `kubectl get ep`)

- That Endpoints resource is used by various controllers

  (e.g. `kube-proxy` when setting up `iptables` rules for ClusterIP services)

- These Endpoints are populated (and updated) with the Service selector

- We can update the Endpoints manually, but our changes will get overwritten

- ... Except if the Service selector is empty!

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Empty Service selector

- If a service selector is empty, Endpoints don't get updated automatically

  (but we can still set them manually)

- This lets us create Services pointing to arbitrary destinations

  (potentially outside the cluster; or things that are not in pods)

- Another use-case: the `kubernetes` service in the `default` namespace

  (its Endpoints are maintained automatically by the API server)

# Authoring YAML

- We have already generated YAML implicitly, with e.g.:

  - `kubectl run`

  - `kubectl create deployment` (and a few other `kubectl create` variants)

  - `kubectl expose`

- When and why do we need to write our own YAML?

- How do we write YAML from scratch?

.debug[[k8s/authoring-yaml.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authoring-yaml.md)]
---

## The limits of generated YAML

- Many advanced (and even not-so-advanced) features require to write YAML:

  - pods with multiple containers

  - resource limits

  - healthchecks

  - DaemonSets, StatefulSets

  - and more!

- How do we access these features?

.debug[[k8s/authoring-yaml.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authoring-yaml.md)]
---

## Various ways to write YAML

- Completely from scratch with our favorite editor

  (yeah, right)

- Dump an existing resource with `kubectl get -o yaml ...`

  (it is recommended to clean up the result)

- Ask `kubectl` to generate the YAML

  (with a `kubectl create --dry-run=client -o yaml`)

- Use The Docs, Luke

  (the documentation almost always has YAML examples)

.debug[[k8s/authoring-yaml.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authoring-yaml.md)]
---

## Generating YAML from scratch

- Start with a namespace:
  ```yaml
    kind: Namespace
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: hello
  ```

- We can use `kubectl explain` to see resource definitions:
  ```bash
  kubectl explain -r pod.spec
  ```

- Not the easiest option!

.debug[[k8s/authoring-yaml.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authoring-yaml.md)]
---

## Dump the YAML for an existing resource

- `kubectl get -o yaml` works!

- A lot of fields in `metadata` are not necessary

  (`managedFields`, `resourceVersion`, `uid`, `creationTimestamp` ...)

- Most objects will have a `status` field that is not necessary

- Default or empty values can also be removed for clarity

- This can be done manually or with the `kubectl-neat` plugin

  `kubectl get -o yaml ... | kubectl neat`

.debug[[k8s/authoring-yaml.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authoring-yaml.md)]
---

## Generating YAML without creating resources

- We can use the `--dry-run=client` option

.lab[

- Generate the YAML for a Deployment without creating it:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment web --image nginx --dry-run=client
  ```

- Optionally clean it up with `kubectl neat`, too

]

class: extra-details

## Using `--dry-run` with `kubectl apply`

- The `--dry-run` option can also be used with `kubectl apply`

- However, it can be misleading (it doesn't do a "real" dry run)

- Let's see what happens in the following scenario:

  - generate the YAML for a Deployment

  - tweak the YAML to transform it into a DaemonSet

  - apply that YAML to see what would actually be created

.debug[[k8s/authoring-yaml.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authoring-yaml.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The limits of `kubectl apply --dry-run=client`

.lab[

- Generate the YAML for a deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment web --image=nginx -o yaml > web.yaml
  ```

- Change the `kind` in the YAML to make it a `DaemonSet`:
  ```bash
  sed -i s/Deployment/DaemonSet/ web.yaml
  ```

- Ask `kubectl` what would be applied:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f web.yaml --dry-run=client --validate=false -o yaml
  ```

]

The resulting YAML doesn't represent a valid DaemonSet.

## Server-side dry run

- Since Kubernetes 1.13, we can use [server-side dry run and diffs](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/01/14/apiserver-dry-run-and-kubectl-diff/)

- Server-side dry run will do all the work, but *not* persist to etcd

  (all validation and mutation hooks will be executed)

.lab[

- Try the same YAML file as earlier, with server-side dry run:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f web.yaml --dry-run=server --validate=false -o yaml
  ```

]

The resulting YAML doesn't have the `replicas` field anymore.

Instead, it has the fields expected in a DaemonSet.

## Advantages of server-side dry run

- The YAML is verified much more extensively

- The only step that is skipped is "write to etcd"

- YAML that passes server-side dry run *should* apply successfully

  (unless the cluster state changes by the time the YAML is actually applied)

- Validating or mutating hooks that have side effects can also be an issue

## `kubectl diff`

- Kubernetes 1.13 also introduced `kubectl diff`

- `kubectl diff` does a server-side dry run, *and* shows differences

.lab[

- Try `kubectl diff` on the YAML that we tweaked earlier:
  ```bash
  kubectl diff -f web.yaml
  ```

<!-- ```wait status:``` -->

]

Note: we don't need to specify `--validate=false` here.

## Advantage of YAML

- Using YAML (instead of `kubectl create <kind>`) allows to be *declarative*

- The YAML describes the desired state of our cluster and applications

- YAML can be stored, versioned, archived (e.g. in git repositories)

- To change resources, change the YAML files

  (instead of using `kubectl edit`/`scale`/`label`/etc.)

- Changes can be reviewed before being applied

  (with code reviews, pull requests ...)

- This workflow is sometimes called "GitOps"

  (there are tools like Weave Flux or GitKube to facilitate it)

.debug[[k8s/authoring-yaml.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authoring-yaml.md)]
---

## YAML in practice

- Get started with `kubectl create deployment` and `kubectl expose`

  (until you have something that works)

- Then, run these commands again, but with `-o yaml --dry-run=client`

  (to generate and save YAML manifests)

- Try to apply these manifests in a clean environment

  (e.g. a new Namespace)

- Check that everything works; tweak and iterate if needed

- Commit the YAML to a repo üíØüèÜÔ∏è

.debug[[k8s/authoring-yaml.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authoring-yaml.md)]
---

## "Day 2" YAML

- Don't hesitate to remove unused fields

  (e.g. `creationTimestamp: null`, most `{}` values...)

- Check your YAML with:

  [kube-score](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score) (installable with krew)

  [kube-linter](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter)

- Check live resources with tools like [popeye](https://popeyecli.io/)

- Remember that like all linters, they need to be configured for your needs!

# Controlling a Kubernetes cluster remotely

- `kubectl` can be used either on cluster instances or outside the cluster

- Here, we are going to use `kubectl` from our local machine

.debug[[k8s/localkubeconfig.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/localkubeconfig.md)]
---

## Requirements

.warning[The commands in this chapter should be run *on your local machine*.]

- `kubectl` is officially available on Linux, macOS, Windows

  (and unofficially anywhere we can build and run Go binaries)

- You may skip these commands if you are following along from:

  - a tablet or phone

  - a web-based terminal

  - an environment where you can't install and run new binaries

.debug[[k8s/localkubeconfig.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/localkubeconfig.md)]
---

## Installing `kubectl`

- If you already have `kubectl` on your local machine, you can skip this

.lab[

<!-- ##VERSION## -->

- Download the `kubectl` binary from one of these links:

  [Linux](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.19.2/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl)
  |
  [macOS](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.19.2/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl)
  |
  [Windows](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.19.2/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe)

- On Linux and macOS, make the binary executable with `chmod +x kubectl`

  (And remember to run it with `./kubectl` or move it to your `$PATH`)

]

Note: if you are following along with a different platform (e.g. Linux on an architecture different from amd64, or with a phone or tablet), installing `kubectl` might be more complicated (or even impossible) so feel free to skip this section.

.debug[[k8s/localkubeconfig.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/localkubeconfig.md)]
---

## Testing `kubectl`

- Check that `kubectl` works correctly

  (before even trying to connect to a remote cluster!)

.lab[

- Ask `kubectl` to show its version number:
  ```bash
  kubectl version --client
  ```

]

The output should look like this:
```
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"15", GitVersion:"v1.15.0",
GitCommit:"e8462b5b5dc2584fdcd18e6bcfe9f1e4d970a529", GitTreeState:"clean",
BuildDate:"2019-06-19T16:40:16Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.5", Compiler:"gc",
Platform:"darwin/amd64"}
```

.debug[[k8s/localkubeconfig.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/localkubeconfig.md)]
---

## Preserving the existing `~/.kube/config`

- If you already have a `~/.kube/config` file, rename it

  (we are going to overwrite it in the following slides!)

- If you never used `kubectl` on your machine before: nothing to do!

.lab[

- Make a copy of `~/.kube/config`; if you are using macOS or Linux, you can do:
  ```bash
  cp ~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config.before.training
  ```

- If you are using Windows, you will need to adapt this command

]

.debug[[k8s/localkubeconfig.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/localkubeconfig.md)]
---

## Copying the configuration file from `node1`

- The `~/.kube/config` file that is on `node1` contains all the credentials we need

- Let's copy it over!

.lab[

- Copy the file from `node1`; if you are using macOS or Linux, you can do:
  ```
  scp `USER`@`X.X.X.X`:.kube/config ~/.kube/config
  # Make sure to replace X.X.X.X with the IP address of node1,
  # and USER with the user name used to log into node1!
  ```

- If you are using Windows, adapt these instructions to your SSH client

]

.debug[[k8s/localkubeconfig.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/localkubeconfig.md)]
---

## Updating the server address

- There is a good chance that we need to update the server address

- To know if it is necessary, run `kubectl config view`

- Look for the `server:` address:

  - if it matches the public IP address of `node1`, you're good!

  - if it is anything else (especially a private IP address), update it!

- To update the server address, run:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-cluster kubernetes --server=https://`X.X.X.X`:6443
  # Make sure to replace X.X.X.X with the IP address of node1!
  ```

.debug[[k8s/localkubeconfig.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/localkubeconfig.md)]

class: extra-details

## What if we get a certificate error?

- Generally, the Kubernetes API uses a certificate that is valid for:

  - `kubernetes`
  - `kubernetes.default`
  - `kubernetes.default.svc`
  - `kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local`
  - the ClusterIP address of the `kubernetes` service
  - the hostname of the node hosting the control plane (e.g. `node1`)
  - the IP address of the node hosting the control plane

- On most clouds, the IP address of the node is an internal IP address

- ... And we are going to connect over the external IP address

- ... And that external IP address was not used when creating the certificate!

.debug[[k8s/localkubeconfig.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/localkubeconfig.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Working around the certificate error

- We need to tell `kubectl` to skip TLS verification

  (only do this with testing clusters, never in production!)

- The following command will do the trick:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-cluster kubernetes --insecure-skip-tls-verify
  ```

.debug[[k8s/localkubeconfig.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/localkubeconfig.md)]
---

## Checking that we can connect to the cluster

- We can now run a couple of trivial commands to check that all is well

.lab[

- Check the versions of the local client and remote server:
  ```bash
  kubectl version
  ```

- View the nodes of the cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

]

We can now utilize the cluster exactly as if we're logged into a node, except that it's remote.

# Accessing internal services

- When we are logged in on a cluster node, we can access internal services

  (by virtue of the Kubernetes network model: all nodes can reach all pods and services)

- When we are accessing a remote cluster, things are different

  (generally, our local machine won't have access to the cluster's internal subnet)

- How can we temporarily access a service without exposing it to everyone?

--

- `kubectl proxy`: gives us access to the API, which includes a proxy for HTTP resources

- `kubectl port-forward`: allows forwarding of TCP ports to arbitrary pods, services, ...

.debug[[k8s/accessinternal.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/accessinternal.md)]
---

## Suspension of disbelief

The labs and demos in this section assume that we have set up `kubectl` on our
local machine in order to access a remote cluster.

We will therefore show how to access services and pods of the remote cluster,
from our local machine.

You can also run these commands directly on the cluster (if you haven't
installed and set up `kubectl` locally).

Running commands locally will be less useful
(since you could access services and pods directly),
but keep in mind that these commands will work anywhere as long as you have
installed and set up `kubectl` to communicate with your cluster.

.debug[[k8s/accessinternal.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/accessinternal.md)]
---

## `kubectl proxy` in theory

- Running `kubectl proxy` gives us access to the entire Kubernetes API

- The API includes routes to proxy HTTP traffic

- These routes look like the following:

  `/api/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/services/<service>/proxy`

- We just add the URI to the end of the request, for instance:

  `/api/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/services/<service>/proxy/index.html`

- We can access `services` and `pods` this way

.debug[[k8s/accessinternal.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/accessinternal.md)]
---

## `kubectl proxy` in practice

- Let's access the `webui` service through `kubectl proxy`

.lab[

- Run an API proxy in the background:
  ```bash
  kubectl proxy &
  ```

- Access the `webui` service:
  ```bash
  curl localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/services/webui/proxy/index.html
  ```

- Terminate the proxy:
  ```bash
  kill %1
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/accessinternal.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/accessinternal.md)]
---

## `kubectl port-forward` in theory

- What if we want to access a TCP service?

- We can use `kubectl port-forward` instead

- It will create a TCP relay to forward connections to a specific port

  (of a pod, service, deployment...)

- The syntax is:

  `kubectl port-forward service/name_of_service local_port:remote_port`

- If only one port number is specified, it is used for both local and remote ports

.debug[[k8s/accessinternal.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/accessinternal.md)]
---

## `kubectl port-forward` in practice

- Let's access our remote Redis server

.lab[

- Forward connections from local port 10000 to remote port 6379:
  ```bash
  kubectl port-forward svc/redis 10000:6379 &
  ```

- Connect to the Redis server:
  ```bash
  telnet localhost 10000
  ```

- Issue a few commands, e.g. `INFO server` then `QUIT`

<!--
```wait Connected to localhost```
```keys INFO server```
```key ^J```
```keys QUIT```
```key ^J```
-->

- Terminate the port forwarder:
  ```bash
  kill %1
  ```

# Rolling updates

- By default (without rolling updates), when a scaled resource is updated:

  - new pods are created

  - old pods are terminated

  - ... all at the same time

  - if something goes wrong, ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Rolling updates

- With rolling updates, when a Deployment is updated, it happens progressively

- The Deployment controls multiple Replica Sets

- Each Replica Set is a group of identical Pods

  (with the same image, arguments, parameters ...)

- During the rolling update, we have at least two Replica Sets:

  - the "new" set (corresponding to the "target" version)

  - at least one "old" set

- We can have multiple "old" sets

  (if we start another update before the first one is done)

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Update strategy

- Two parameters determine the pace of the rollout: `maxUnavailable` and `maxSurge`

- They can be specified in absolute number of pods, or percentage of the `replicas` count

- At any given time ...

  - there will always be at least `replicas`-`maxUnavailable` pods available

  - there will never be more than `replicas`+`maxSurge` pods in total

  - there will therefore be up to `maxUnavailable`+`maxSurge` pods being updated

- We have the possibility of rolling back to the previous version
  <br/>(if the update fails or is unsatisfactory in any way)

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Checking current rollout parameters

- Recall how we build custom reports with `kubectl` and `jq`:

.lab[

- Show the rollout plan for our deployments:
  ```bash
    kubectl get deploy -o json |
            jq ".items[] | {name:.metadata.name} + .spec.strategy.rollingUpdate"
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Rolling updates in practice

- As of Kubernetes 1.8, we can do rolling updates with:

  `deployments`, `daemonsets`, `statefulsets`

- Editing one of these resources will automatically result in a rolling update

- Rolling updates can be monitored with the `kubectl rollout` subcommand

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Rolling out the new `worker` service

.lab[

- Let's monitor what's going on by opening a few terminals, and run:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -w
  kubectl get replicasets -w
  kubectl get deployments -w
  ```

<!--
```wait NAME```
```key ^C```
-->

- Update `worker` either with `kubectl edit`, or by running:
  ```bash
  kubectl set image deploy worker worker=dockercoins/worker:v0.2
  ```

]

--

That rollout should be pretty quick. What shows in the web UI?

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Give it some time

- At first, it looks like nothing is happening (the graph remains at the same level)

- According to `kubectl get deploy -w`, the `deployment` was updated really quickly

- But `kubectl get pods -w` tells a different story

- The old `pods` are still here, and they stay in `Terminating` state for a while

- Eventually, they are terminated; and then the graph decreases significantly

- This delay is due to the fact that our worker doesn't handle signals

- Kubernetes sends a "polite" shutdown request to the worker, which ignores it

- After a grace period, Kubernetes gets impatient and kills the container

  (The grace period is 30 seconds, but [can be changed](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/#termination-of-pods) if needed)

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Rolling out something invalid

- What happens if we make a mistake?

.lab[

- Update `worker` by specifying a non-existent image:
  ```bash
  kubectl set image deploy worker worker=dockercoins/worker:v0.3
  ```

- Check what's going on:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout status deploy worker
  ```

<!--
```wait Waiting for deployment```
```key ^C```
-->

]

Our rollout is stuck. However, the app is not dead.

(After a minute, it will stabilize to be 20-25% slower.)

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## What's going on with our rollout?

- Why is our app a bit slower?

- Because `MaxUnavailable=25%`

  ... So the rollout terminated 2 replicas out of 10 available

- Okay, but why do we see 5 new replicas being rolled out?

- Because `MaxSurge=25%`

  ... So in addition to replacing 2 replicas, the rollout is also starting 3 more

- It rounded down the number of MaxUnavailable pods conservatively,
  <br/>
  but the total number of pods being rolled out is allowed to be 25+25=50%

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The nitty-gritty details

- We start with 10 pods running for the `worker` deployment

- Current settings: MaxUnavailable=25% and MaxSurge=25%

- When we start the rollout:

  - two replicas are taken down (as per MaxUnavailable=25%)
  - two others are created (with the new version) to replace them
  - three others are created (with the new version) per MaxSurge=25%)

- Now we have 8 replicas up and running, and 5 being deployed

- Our rollout is stuck at this point!

## Checking the dashboard during the bad rollout

If you didn't deploy the Kubernetes dashboard earlier, just skip this slide.

.lab[

- Connect to the dashboard that we deployed earlier

- Check that we have failures in Deployments, Pods, and Replica Sets

- Can we see the reason for the failure?

]

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Recovering from a bad rollout

- We could push some `v0.3` image

  (the pod retry logic will eventually catch it and the rollout will proceed)

- Or we could invoke a manual rollback

.lab[

<!-- ```key ^C``` -->

- Cancel the deployment and wait for the dust to settle:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout undo deploy worker
  kubectl rollout status deploy worker
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Rolling back to an older version

- We reverted to `v0.2`

- But this version still has a performance problem

- How can we get back to the previous version?

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Multiple "undos"

- What happens if we try `kubectl rollout undo` again?

.lab[

- Try it:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout undo deployment worker
  ```

- Check the web UI, the list of pods ...

]

ü§î That didn't work.

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Multiple "undos" don't work

- If we see successive versions as a stack:

  - `kubectl rollout undo` doesn't "pop" the last element from the stack

  - it copies the N-1th element to the top

- Multiple "undos" just swap back and forth between the last two versions!

.lab[

- Go back to v0.2 again:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout undo deployment worker
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## In this specific scenario

- Our version numbers are easy to guess

- What if we had used git hashes?

- What if we had changed other parameters in the Pod spec?

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Listing versions

- We can list successive versions of a Deployment with `kubectl rollout history`

.lab[

- Look at our successive versions:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout history deployment worker
  ```

]

We don't see *all* revisions.

We might see something like 1, 4, 5.

(Depending on how many "undos" we did before.)

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Explaining deployment revisions

- These revisions correspond to our Replica Sets

- This information is stored in the Replica Set annotations

.lab[

- Check the annotations for our replica sets:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe replicasets -l app=worker | grep -A3 ^Annotations
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## What about the missing revisions?

- The missing revisions are stored in another annotation:

  `deployment.kubernetes.io/revision-history`

- These are not shown in `kubectl rollout history`

- We could easily reconstruct the full list with a script

  (if we wanted to!)

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Rolling back to an older version

- `kubectl rollout undo` can work with a revision number

.lab[

- Roll back to the "known good" deployment version:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout undo deployment worker --to-revision=1
  ```

- Check the web UI or the list of pods

]

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Changing rollout parameters

- We want to:

  - revert to `v0.1`
  - be conservative on availability (always have desired number of available workers)
  - go slow on rollout speed (update only one pod at a time) 
  - give some time to our workers to "warm up" before starting more

The corresponding changes can be expressed in the following YAML snippet:

.small[
```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: worker
        image: dockercoins/worker:v0.1
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 0
      maxSurge: 1
  minReadySeconds: 10

## Applying changes through a YAML patch

- We could use `kubectl edit deployment worker`

- But we could also use `kubectl patch` with the exact YAML shown before

.lab[

.small[

- Apply all our changes and wait for them to take effect:
  ```bash
  kubectl patch deployment worker -p "
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: worker
            image: dockercoins/worker:v0.1
      strategy:
        rollingUpdate:
          maxUnavailable: 0
          maxSurge: 1
      minReadySeconds: 10
    "
  kubectl rollout status deployment worker
  kubectl get deploy -o json worker |
          jq "{name:.metadata.name} + .spec.strategy.rollingUpdate"

# Healthchecks

- Containers can have *healthchecks*

- There are three kinds of healthchecks, corresponding to very different use-cases:

  - liveness  = detect when a container is "dead" and needs to be restarted

  - readiness = detect when a container is ready to serve traffic

  - startup = detect if a container has finished to boot

- These healthchecks are optional (we can use none, all, or some of them)

- Different probes are available (HTTP request, TCP connection, program execution)

- Let's see the difference and how to use them!

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Liveness probe

*This container is dead, we don't know how to fix it, other than restarting it.*

- Indicates if the container is dead or alive

- A dead container cannot come back to life

- If the liveness probe fails, the container is killed (destroyed)

  (to make really sure that it's really dead; no zombies or undeads!)

- What happens next depends on the pod's `restartPolicy`:

  - `Never`: the container is not restarted

  - `OnFailure` or `Always`: the container is restarted

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## When to use a liveness probe

- To indicate failures that can't be recovered

  - deadlocks (causing all requests to time out)

  - internal corruption (causing all requests to error)

- Anything where our incident response would be "just restart/reboot it"

.warning[**Do not** use liveness probes for problems that can't be fixed by a restart]

- Otherwise we just restart our pods for no reason, creating useless load

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Readiness probe (1)

*Make sure that a container is ready before continuing a rolling update.*

- Indicates if the container is ready to handle traffic

- When doing a rolling update, the Deployment controller waits for Pods to be ready

  (a Pod is ready when all the containers in the Pod are ready)

- Improves reliability and safety of rolling updates:

  - don't roll out a broken version (that doesn't pass readiness checks)

  - don't lose processing capacity during a rolling update

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Readiness probe (2)

*Temporarily remove a container (overloaded or otherwise) from a Service load balancer.*

- A container can mark itself "not ready" temporarily

  (e.g. if it's overloaded or needs to reload/restart/garbage collect...)

- If a container becomes "unready" it might be ready again soon

- If the readiness probe fails:

  - the container is *not* killed

  - if the pod is a member of a service, it is temporarily removed

  - it is re-added as soon as the readiness probe passes again

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## When to use a readiness probe

- To indicate failure due to an external cause

  - database is down or unreachable

  - mandatory auth or other backend service unavailable

- To indicate temporary failure or unavailability

  - application can only service *N* parallel connections

  - runtime is busy doing garbage collection or initial data load

- To redirect new connections to other Pods

  (e.g. fail the readiness probe when the Pod's load is too high)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Dependencies

- If a web server depends on a database to function, and the database is down:

  - the web server's liveness probe should succeed

  - the web server's readiness probe should fail

- Same thing for any hard dependency (without which the container can't work)

.warning[**Do not** fail liveness probes for problems that are external to the container]

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Timing and thresholds

- Probes are executed at intervals of `periodSeconds` (default: 10)

- The timeout for a probe is set with `timeoutSeconds` (default: 1)

.warning[If a probe takes longer than that, it is considered as a FAIL]

- A probe is considered successful after `successThreshold` successes (default: 1)

- A probe is considered failing after `failureThreshold` failures (default: 3)

- A probe can have an `initialDelaySeconds` parameter (default: 0)

- Kubernetes will wait that amount of time before running the probe for the first time

  (this is important to avoid killing services that take a long time to start)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Startup probe

*The container takes too long to start, and is killed by the liveness probe!*

- By default, probes (including liveness) start immediately

- With the default probe interval and failure threshold:

  *a container must respond in less than 30 seconds, or it will be killed!*

- There are two ways to avoid that:

  - set `initialDelaySeconds` (a fixed, rigid delay)

  - use a `startupProbe`

- Kubernetes will run only the startup probe, and when it succeeds, run the other probes

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## When to use a startup probe

- For containers that take a long time to start

  (more than 30 seconds)

- Especially if that time can vary a lot

  (e.g. fast in dev, slow in prod, or the other way around)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Different types of probes

- HTTP request

  - specify URL of the request (and optional headers)

  - any status code between 200 and 399 indicates success

- TCP connection

  - the probe succeeds if the TCP port is open

- arbitrary exec

  - a command is executed in the container

  - exit status of zero indicates success

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Benefits of using probes

- Rolling updates proceed when containers are *actually ready*

  (as opposed to merely started)

- Containers in a broken state get killed and restarted

  (instead of serving errors or timeouts)

- Unavailable backends get removed from load balancer rotation

  (thus improving response times across the board)

- If a probe is not defined, it's as if there was an "always successful" probe

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Example: HTTP probe

Here is a pod template for the `rng` web service of the DockerCoins app:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: healthy-app
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp
    image: myregistry.io/myapp:v1.0
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /health
        port: 80
      periodSeconds: 5
```

If the backend serves an error, or takes longer than 1s, 3 times in a row, it gets killed.

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Example: exec probe

Here is a pod template for a Redis server:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: redis-with-liveness
spec:
  containers:
  - name: redis
    image: redis
    livenessProbe:
      exec:
        command: ["redis-cli", "ping"]
```

If the Redis process becomes unresponsive, it will be killed.

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Questions to ask before adding healthchecks

- Do we want liveness, readiness, both?

  (sometimes, we can use the same check, but with different failure thresholds)

- Do we have existing HTTP endpoints that we can use?

- Do we need to add new endpoints, or perhaps use something else?

- Are our healthchecks likely to use resources and/or slow down the app?

- Do they depend on additional services?

  (this can be particularly tricky, see next slide)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Healthchecks and dependencies

- Liveness checks should not be influenced by the state of external services

- All checks should reply quickly (by default, less than 1 second)

- Otherwise, they are considered to fail

- This might require to check the health of dependencies asynchronously

  (e.g. if a database or API might be healthy but still take more than
  1 second to reply, we should check the status asynchronously and report
  a cached status)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Healthchecks for workers

(In that context, worker = process that doesn't accept connections)

- Readiness is useful mostly for rolling updates

  (because workers aren't backends for a service)

- Liveness may help us restart a broken worker, but how can we check it?

- Embedding an HTTP server is a (potentially expensive) option

- Using a "lease" file can be relatively easy:

  - touch a file during each iteration of the main loop

  - check the timestamp of that file from an exec probe

- Writing logs (and checking them from the probe) also works

# Recording deployment actions

- Some commands that modify a Deployment accept an optional `--record` flag

  (Example: `kubectl set image deployment worker worker=alpine --record`)

- That flag will store the command line in the Deployment

  (Technically, using the annotation `kubernetes.io/change-cause`)

- It gets copied to the corresponding ReplicaSet

  (Allowing to keep track of which command created or promoted this ReplicaSet)

- We can view this information with `kubectl rollout history`

.debug[[k8s/record.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/record.md)]
---

## Using `--record`

- Let's make a couple of changes to a Deployment and record them

.lab[

- Roll back `worker` to image version 0.1:
  ```bash
  kubectl set image deployment worker worker=dockercoins/worker:v0.1 --record
  ```

- Promote it to version 0.2 again:
  ```bash
  kubectl set image deployment worker worker=dockercoins/worker:v0.2 --record
  ```

- View the change history:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout history deployment worker
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/record.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/record.md)]
---

## Pitfall #1: forgetting `--record`

- What happens if we don't specify `--record`?

.lab[

- Promote `worker` to image version 0.3:
  ```bash
  kubectl set image deployment worker worker=dockercoins/worker:v0.3
  ```

- View the change history:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout history deployment worker
  ```

]

--

It recorded version 0.2 instead of 0.3! Why?

.debug[[k8s/record.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/record.md)]
---

## How `--record` really works

- `kubectl` adds the annotation `kubernetes.io/change-cause` to the Deployment

- The Deployment controller copies that annotation to the ReplicaSet

- `kubectl rollout history` shows the ReplicaSets' annotations

- If we don't specify `--record`, the annotation is not updated

- The previous value of that annotation is copied to the new ReplicaSet

- In that case, the ReplicaSet annotation does not reflect reality!

.debug[[k8s/record.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/record.md)]
---

## Pitfall #2: recording `scale` commands

- What happens if we use `kubectl scale --record`?

.lab[

- Check the current history:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout history deployment worker
  ```

- Scale the deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment worker --replicas=3 --record
  ```

- Check the change history again:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout history deployment worker
  ```

]

--

The last entry in the history was overwritten by the `scale` command! Why?

.debug[[k8s/record.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/record.md)]
---

## Actions that don't create a new ReplicaSet

- The `scale` command updates the Deployment definition

- But it doesn't create a new ReplicaSet

- Using the `--record` flag sets the annotation like before

- The annotation gets copied to the existing ReplicaSet

- This overwrites the previous annotation that was there

- In that case, we lose the previous change cause!

.debug[[k8s/record.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/record.md)]
---

## Updating the annotation directly

- Let's see what happens if we set the annotation manually

.lab[

- Annotate the Deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl annotate deployment worker kubernetes.io/change-cause="Just for fun"
  ```

- Check that our annotation shows up in the change history:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout history deployment worker
  ```

]

--

Our annotation shows up (and overwrote whatever was there before).

.debug[[k8s/record.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/record.md)]
---

## Using change cause

- It sounds like a good idea to use `--record`, but:

  *"Incorrect documentation is often worse than no documentation."*
  <br/>
  (Bertrand Meyer)

- If we use `--record` once, we need to either:

  - use it every single time after that

  - or clear the Deployment annotation after using `--record`
    <br/>
    (subsequent changes will show up with a `<none>` change cause)

- A safer way is to set it through our tooling

# Namespaces

- We would like to deploy another copy of DockerCoins on our cluster

- We could rename all our deployments and services:

  hasher ‚Üí hasher2, redis ‚Üí redis2, rng ‚Üí rng2, etc.

- That would require updating the code

- There has to be a better way!

--

- As hinted by the title of this section, we will use *namespaces*

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Identifying a resource

- We cannot have two resources with the same name

  (or can we...?)

--

- We cannot have two resources *of the same kind* with the same name

  (but it's OK to have an `rng` service, an `rng` deployment, and an `rng` daemon set)

--

- We cannot have two resources of the same kind with the same name *in the same namespace*

  (but it's OK to have e.g. two `rng` services in different namespaces)

--

- Except for resources that exist at the *cluster scope*

  (these do not belong to a namespace)

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Uniquely identifying a resource

- For *namespaced* resources:

  the tuple *(kind, name, namespace)* needs to be unique

- For resources at the *cluster scope*:

  the tuple *(kind, name)* needs to be unique

.lab[

- List resource types again, and check the NAMESPACED column:
  ```bash
  kubectl api-resources
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Pre-existing namespaces

- If we deploy a cluster with `kubeadm`, we have three or four namespaces:

  - `default` (for our applications)

  - `kube-system` (for the control plane)

  - `kube-public` (contains one ConfigMap for cluster discovery)

  - `kube-node-lease` (in Kubernetes 1.14 and later; contains Lease objects)

- If we deploy differently, we may have different namespaces

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Creating namespaces

- Let's see two identical methods to create a namespace

.lab[

- We can use `kubectl create namespace`:
  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace blue
  ```

- Or we can construct a very minimal YAML snippet:
  ```bash
	kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
	apiVersion: v1
	kind: Namespace
	metadata:
	  name: blue
	EOF
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Using namespaces

- We can pass a `-n` or `--namespace` flag to most `kubectl` commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n blue get svc
  ```

- We can also change our current *context*

- A context is a *(user, cluster, namespace)* tuple

- We can manipulate contexts with the `kubectl config` command

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Viewing existing contexts

- On our training environments, at this point, there should be only one context

.lab[

- View existing contexts to see the cluster name and the current user:
  ```bash
  kubectl config get-contexts
  ```

]

- The current context (the only one!) is tagged with a `*`

- What are NAME, CLUSTER, AUTHINFO, and NAMESPACE?

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## What's in a context

- NAME is an arbitrary string to identify the context

- CLUSTER is a reference to a cluster

  (i.e. API endpoint URL, and optional certificate)

- AUTHINFO is a reference to the authentication information to use

  (i.e. a TLS client certificate, token, or otherwise)

- NAMESPACE is the namespace

  (empty string = `default`)

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Switching contexts

- We want to use a different namespace

- Solution 1: update the current context

  *This is appropriate if we need to change just one thing (e.g. namespace or authentication).*

- Solution 2: create a new context and switch to it

  *This is appropriate if we need to change multiple things and switch back and forth.*

- Let's go with solution 1!

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Updating a context

- This is done through `kubectl config set-context`

- We can update a context by passing its name, or the current context with `--current`

.lab[

- Update the current context to use the `blue` namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=blue
  ```

- Check the result:
  ```bash
  kubectl config get-contexts
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Using our new namespace

- Let's check that we are in our new namespace, then deploy a new copy of Dockercoins

.lab[

- Verify that the new context is empty:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Deploying DockerCoins with YAML files

- The GitHub repository `jpetazzo/kubercoins` contains everything we need!

.lab[

- Clone the kubercoins repository:
  ```bash
  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/jpetazzo/kubercoins
  ```

- Create all the DockerCoins resources:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f kubercoins
  ```

]

If the argument behind `-f` is a directory, all the files in that directory are processed. 

The subdirectories are *not* processed, unless we also add the `-R` flag.

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Viewing the deployed app

- Let's see if this worked correctly!

.lab[

- Retrieve the port number allocated to the `webui` service:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc webui
  ```

- Point our browser to http://X.X.X.X:3xxxx

]

If the graph shows up but stays at zero, give it a minute or two!

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Namespaces and isolation

- Namespaces *do not* provide isolation

- A pod in the `green` namespace can communicate with a pod in the `blue` namespace

- A pod in the `default` namespace can communicate with a pod in the `kube-system` namespace

- CoreDNS uses a different subdomain for each namespace

- Example: from any pod in the cluster, you can connect to the Kubernetes API with:

  `https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local:443/`

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Isolating pods

- Actual isolation is implemented with *network policies*

- Network policies are resources (like deployments, services, namespaces...)

- Network policies specify which flows are allowed:

  - between pods

  - from pods to the outside world

  - and vice-versa

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Switch back to the default namespace

- Let's make sure that we don't run future exercises and labs in the `blue` namespace

.lab[

- Switch back to the original context:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=
  ```

]

Note: we could have used `--namespace=default` for the same result.

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Switching namespaces more easily

- We can also use a little helper tool called `kubens`:

  ```bash
  # Switch to namespace foo
  kubens foo
  # Switch back to the previous namespace
  kubens -
  ```

- On our clusters, `kubens` is called `kns` instead

  (so that it's even fewer keystrokes to switch namespaces)

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

##  `kubens` and `kubectx`

- With `kubens`, we can switch quickly between namespaces

- With `kubectx`, we can switch quickly between contexts

- Both tools are simple shell scripts available from https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx

- On our clusters, they are installed as `kns` and `kctx`

  (for brevity and to avoid completion clashes between `kubectx` and `kubectl`)

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## `kube-ps1`

- It's easy to lose track of our current cluster / context / namespace

- `kube-ps1` makes it easy to track these, by showing them in our shell prompt

- It is installed on our training clusters, and when using [shpod](https://github.com/jpetazzo/shpod)

- It gives us a prompt looking like this one:
  ```
  [123.45.67.89] `(kubernetes-admin@kubernetes:default)` docker@node1 ~
  ```
  (The highlighted part is `context:namespace`, managed by `kube-ps1`)

- Highly recommended if you work across multiple contexts or namespaces!

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Installing `kube-ps1`

- It's a simple shell script available from https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-ps1

- It needs to be [installed in our profile/rc files](https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-ps1#installing)

  (instructions differ depending on platform, shell, etc.)

- Once installed, it defines aliases called `kube_ps1`, `kubeon`, `kubeoff`

  (to selectively enable/disable it when needed)

- Pro-tip: install it on your machine during the next break!

# Exposing HTTP services with Ingress resources

- HTTP services are typically exposed on port 80

  (and 443 for HTTPS)

- `NodePort` services are great, but they are *not* on port 80

  (by default, they use port range 30000-32767)

- How can we get *many* HTTP services on port 80? ü§î

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Various ways to expose something on port 80

- Service with `type: LoadBalancer`

  *costs a little bit of money; not always available*

- Service with one (or multiple) `ExternalIP`

  *requires public nodes; limited by number of nodes*

- Service with `hostPort` or `hostNetwork`

  *same limitations as `ExternalIP`; even harder to manage*

- Ingress resources

  *addresses all these limitations, yay!*

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## `LoadBalancer` vs `Ingress`

- Service with `type: LoadBalancer`

  - requires a particular controller (e.g. CCM, MetalLB)
  - if TLS is desired, it has to be implemented by the app
  - works for any TCP protocol (not just HTTP)
  - doesn't interpret the HTTP protocol (no fancy routing)
  - costs a bit of money for each service

- Ingress

  - requires an ingress controller
  - can implement TLS transparently for the app
  - only supports HTTP
  - can do content-based routing (e.g. per URI)
  - lower cost per service
    <br/>(exact pricing depends on provider's model)

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Ingress resources

- Kubernetes API resource (`kubectl get ingress`/`ingresses`/`ing`)

- Designed to expose HTTP services

- Requires an *ingress controller*

  (otherwise, resources can be created, but nothing happens)

- Some ingress controllers are based on existing load balancers

  (HAProxy, NGINX...)

- Some are standalone, and sometimes designed for Kubernetes

  (Contour, Traefik...)

- Note: there is no "default" or "official" ingress controller!

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Ingress standard features

- Load balancing

- SSL termination

- Name-based virtual hosting

- URI routing

  (e.g. `/api`‚Üí`api-service`, `/static`‚Üí`assets-service`)

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Ingress extended features

(Not always supported; supported through annotations, CRDs, etc.)

- Routing with other headers or cookies

- A/B testing

- Canary deployment

- etc.

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Principle of operation

- Step 1: deploy an *ingress controller*

  (one-time setup)

- Step 2: create *Ingress resources*

  - maps a domain and/or path to a Kubernetes Service

  - the controller watches ingress resources and sets up a LB

- Step 3: set up DNS

  - associate DNS entries with the load balancer address

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Special cases

- GKE has "[GKE Ingress]", a custom ingress controller

  (enabled by default)

- EKS has "AWS ALB Ingress Controller" as well

  (not enabled by default, requires extra setup)

- They leverage cloud-specific HTTP load balancers

  (GCP HTTP LB, AWS ALB)

- They typically a cost *per ingress resource*

[GKE Ingress]: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ingress

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Single or multiple LoadBalancer

- Most ingress controllers will create a LoadBalancer Service

  (and will receive all HTTP/HTTPS traffic through it)

- We need to point our DNS entries to the IP address of that LB

- Some rare ingress controllers will allocate one LB per ingress resource

  (example: the GKE Ingress and ALB Ingress mentioned previously)

- This leads to increased costs

- Note that it's possible to have multiple "rules" per ingress resource

  (this will reduce costs but may be less convenient to manage)

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Ingress in action

- We will deploy the Traefik ingress controller

  - this is an arbitrary choice

  - maybe motivated by the fact that Traefik releases are named after cheeses

- For DNS, we will use [nip.io](http://nip.io/)

  - `*.1.2.3.4.nip.io` resolves to `1.2.3.4`

- We will create ingress resources for various HTTP services

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Deploying pods listening on port 80

- We want our ingress load balancer to be available on port 80

- The best way to do that would be with a `LoadBalancer` service

  ... but it requires support from the underlying infrastructure

- Instead, we are going to use the `hostNetwork` mode on the Traefik pods

- Let's see what this `hostNetwork` mode is about ...

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Without `hostNetwork`

- Normally, each pod gets its own *network namespace*

  (sometimes called sandbox or network sandbox)

- An IP address is assigned to the pod

- This IP address is routed/connected to the cluster network

- All containers of that pod are sharing that network namespace

  (and therefore using the same IP address)

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## With `hostNetwork: true`

- No network namespace gets created

- The pod is using the network namespace of the host

- It "sees" (and can use) the interfaces (and IP addresses) of the host

- The pod can receive outside traffic directly, on any port

- Downside: with most network plugins, network policies won't work for that pod

  - most network policies work at the IP address level

  - filtering that pod = filtering traffic from the node

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Other techniques to expose port 80

- We could use pods specifying `hostPort: 80` 

  ... but with most CNI plugins, this [doesn't work or requires additional setup](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/23920)

- We could use a `NodePort` service

  ... but that requires [changing the `--service-node-port-range` flag in the API server](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/)

- We could create a service with an external IP

  ... this would work, but would require a few extra steps

  (figuring out the IP address and adding it to the service)

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Running Traefik

- The [Traefik documentation][traefikdoc] recommends to use a Helm chart

- For simplicity, we're going to use a custom YAML manifest

- Our manifest will:

  - use a Daemon Set so that each node can accept connections

  - enable `hostNetwork`

  - add a *toleration* so that Traefik also runs on all nodes

- We could do the same with the official [Helm chart][traefikchart]

[traefikdoc]: https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/install-traefik/#use-the-helm-chart
[traefikchart]: https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/traefik/traefik

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Taints and tolerations

- A *taint* is an attribute added to a node

- It prevents pods from running on the node

- ... Unless they have a matching *toleration*

- When deploying with `kubeadm`:

  - a taint is placed on the node dedicated to the control plane

  - the pods running the control plane have a matching toleration

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Checking taints on our nodes

.lab[

- Check our nodes specs:
  ```bash
  kubectl get node node1 -o json | jq .spec
  kubectl get node node2 -o json | jq .spec
  ```

]

We should see a result only for `node1` (the one with the control plane):

```json
  "taints": [
    {
      "effect": "NoSchedule",
      "key": "node-role.kubernetes.io/master"
    }
  ]
```

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Understanding a taint

- The `key` can be interpreted as:

  - a reservation for a special set of pods
    <br/>
    (here, this means "this node is reserved for the control plane")

  - an error condition on the node
    <br/>
    (for instance: "disk full," do not start new pods here!)

- The `effect` can be:

  - `NoSchedule` (don't run new pods here)

  - `PreferNoSchedule` (try not to run new pods here)

  - `NoExecute` (don't run new pods and evict running pods)

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Checking tolerations on the control plane

.lab[

- Check tolerations for CoreDNS:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-system get deployments coredns -o json |
          jq .spec.template.spec.tolerations
  ```

]

The result should include:
```json
  {
    "effect": "NoSchedule",
    "key": "node-role.kubernetes.io/master"
  }
```

It means: "bypass the exact taint that we saw earlier on `node1`."

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Special tolerations

.lab[

- Check tolerations on `kube-proxy`:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-system get ds kube-proxy -o json | 
          jq .spec.template.spec.tolerations
  ```

]

The result should include:
```json
  {
    "operator": "Exists"
  }
```

This one is a special case that means "ignore all taints and run anyway."

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Running Traefik on our cluster

- We provide a YAML file (`k8s/traefik.yaml`) which is essentially the sum of:

  - [Traefik's Daemon Set resources](https://github.com/containous/traefik/blob/v1.7/examples/k8s/traefik-ds.yaml) (patched with `hostNetwork` and tolerations)

  - [Traefik's RBAC rules](https://github.com/containous/traefik/blob/v1.7/examples/k8s/traefik-rbac.yaml) allowing it to watch necessary API objects

.lab[

- Apply the YAML:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/traefik.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Checking that Traefik runs correctly

- If Traefik started correctly, we now have a web server listening on each node

.lab[

- Check that Traefik is serving 80/tcp:
  ```bash
  curl localhost
  ```

]

We should get a `404 page not found` error.

This is normal: we haven't provided any ingress rule yet.

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Setting up DNS

- To make our lives easier, we will use [nip.io](http://nip.io)

- Check out `http://red.A.B.C.D.nip.io`

  (replacing A.B.C.D with the IP address of `node1`)

- We should get the same `404 page not found` error

  (meaning that our DNS is "set up properly", so to speak!)

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Traefik web UI

- Traefik provides a web dashboard

- With the current install method, it's listening on port 8080

.lab[

- Go to `http://node1:8080` (replacing `node1` with its IP address)

<!-- ```open http://node1:8080``` -->

]

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Setting up host-based routing ingress rules

- We are going to use the `jpetazzo/color` image

- This image contains a simple static HTTP server on port 80

- We will run 3 deployments (`red`, `green`, `blue`)

- We will create 3 services (one for each deployment)

- Then we will create 3 ingress rules (one for each service)

- We will route `<color>.A.B.C.D.nip.io` to the corresponding deployment

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Running colorful web servers

.lab[

- Run all three deployments:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment red   --image=jpetazzo/color
  kubectl create deployment green --image=jpetazzo/color
  kubectl create deployment blue  --image=jpetazzo/color
  ```

- Create a service for each of them:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment red   --port=80
  kubectl expose deployment green --port=80
  kubectl expose deployment blue  --port=80
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Creating ingress resources

- Before Kubernetes 1.19, we must use YAML manifests

  (see example on next slide)

- Since Kubernetes 1.19, we can use `kubectl create ingress`

  ```bash
  kubectl create ingress red \
      --rule=red.`A.B.C.D`.nip.io/*=red:80
  ```

- We can specify multiple rules per resource

  ```bash
  kubectl create ingress rgb \
      --rule=red.`A.B.C.D`.nip.io/*=red:80 \
      --rule=green.`A.B.C.D`.nip.io/*=green:80 \
      --rule=blue.`A.B.C.D`.nip.io/*=blue:80
  ```

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Pay attention to the `*`!

- The `*` is important:

  ```
  --rule=red.A.B.C.D.nip.io/`*`=red:80
  ```

- It means "all URIs below that path"

- Without the `*`, it means "only that exact path"

  (if we omit it, requests for e.g. `red.A.B.C.D.nip.io/hello` will 404)

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Ingress resources in YAML

Here is a minimal host-based ingress resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: red
spec:
  rules:
  - host: red.`A.B.C.D`.nip.io
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: red
          servicePort: 80

```

(It is in `k8s/ingress.yaml`.)

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Ingress API version

- The YAML on the previous slide uses `apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1`

- Starting with Kubernetes 1.19, `networking.k8s.io/v1` is available

- However, with Kubernetes 1.19 (and later), we can use `kubectl create ingress`

- We chose to keep an "old" (deprecated!) YAML example for folks still using older versions of Kubernetes

- If we want to see "modern" YAML, we can use `-o yaml --dry-run=client`:

  ```bash
  kubectl create ingress red -o yaml --dry-run=client \
      --rule=red.`A.B.C.D`.nip.io/*=red:80

  ```

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Creating ingress resources

- Create the ingress resources with `kubectl create ingress`

  (or use the YAML manifests if using Kubernetes 1.18 or older)

- Make sure to update the hostnames!

- Check that you can connect to the exposed web apps

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Using multiple ingress controllers

- You can have multiple ingress controllers active simultaneously

  (e.g. Traefik and NGINX)

- You can even have multiple instances of the same controller

  (e.g. one for internal, another for external traffic)

- To indicate which ingress controller should be used by a given Ingress resouce:

  - before Kubernetes 1.18, use the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation

  - since Kubernetes 1.18, use the `ingressClassName` field
    <br/>
    (which should refer to an existing `IngressClass` resource)

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Ingress shortcomings

- A lot of things have been left out of the Ingress v1 spec

  (routing requests according to weight, cookies, across namespaces...)

- Example: stripping path prefixes

  - NGINX: [nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/docs/examples/rewrite/README.md)

  - Traefik v1: [traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/rule-type: PathPrefixStrip](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/migration/v1-to-v2/#strip-and-rewrite-path-prefixes)

  - Traefik v2: [requires a CRD](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/migration/v1-to-v2/#strip-and-rewrite-path-prefixes)

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Ingress in the future

- The [Gateway API SIG](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) might be the future of Ingress

- It proposes new resources:

 GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute, TCPRoute...

- It is still in alpha stage

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Vendor-specific example

- Let's see how to implement *canary releases*

- The example here will use Traefik v1

  (which is obsolete)

- It won't work on your Kubernetes cluster!

  (unless you're running an oooooold version of Kubernetes)

  (and an equally oooooooold version of Traefik)

- We've left it here just as an example!

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Canary releases

- A *canary release* (or canary launch or canary deployment) is a release that will process only a small fraction of the workload

- After deploying the canary, we compare its metrics to the normal release

- If the metrics look good, the canary will progressively receive more traffic

  (until it gets 100% and becomes the new normal release)

- If the metrics aren't good, the canary is automatically removed

- When we deploy a bad release, only a tiny fraction of traffic is affected

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Various ways to implement canary

- Example 1: canary for a microservice

  - 1% of all requests (sampled randomly) are sent to the canary
  - the remaining 99% are sent to the normal release

- Example 2: canary for a web app

  - 1% of users are sent to the canary web site
  - the remaining 99% are sent to the normal release

- Example 3: canary for shipping physical goods

  - 1% of orders are shipped with the canary process
  - the remaining 99% are shipped with the normal process

- We're going to implement example 1 (per-request routing)

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Canary releases with Traefik v1

- We need to deploy the canary and expose it with a separate service

- Then, in the Ingress resource, we need:

  - multiple `paths` entries (one for each service, canary and normal)

  - an extra annotation indicating the weight of each service

- If we want, we can send requests to more than 2 services

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## The Ingress resource

.small[
```yaml

```
]

class: extra-details

## Other ingress controllers

*Just to illustrate how different things are ...*

- With the NGINX ingress controller:

  - define two ingress ressources
    <br/>
    (specifying rules with the same host+path)

  - add `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary` annotations on each


- With Linkerd2:

  - define two services

  - define an extra service for the weighted aggregate of the two

  - define a TrafficSplit (this is a CRD introduced by the SMI spec)

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## We need more than that

What we saw is just one of the multiple building blocks that we need to achieve a canary release.

We also need:

- metrics (latency, performance ...) for our releases

- automation to alter canary weights

  (increase canary weight if metrics look good; decrease otherwise)

- a mechanism to manage the lifecycle of the canary releases

  (create them, promote them, delete them ...)

For inspiration, check [flagger by Weave](https://github.com/weaveworks/flagger).

# Kustomize

- Kustomize lets us transform Kubernetes resources:

  *YAML + kustomize ‚Üí new YAML*

- Starting point = valid resource files

  (i.e. something that we could load with `kubectl apply -f`)

- Recipe = a *kustomization* file

  (describing how to transform the resources)

- Result = new resource files

  (that we can load with `kubectl apply -f`)

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Pros and cons

- Relatively easy to get started

  (just get some existing YAML files)

- Easy to leverage existing "upstream" YAML files

  (or other *kustomizations*)

- Somewhat integrated with `kubectl`

  (but only "somewhat" because of version discrepancies)

- Less complex than e.g. Helm, but also less powerful

- No central index like the Artifact Hub (but is there a need for it?)

## Kustomize in a nutshell

- Get some valid YAML (our "resources")

- Write a *kustomization* (technically, a file named `kustomization.yaml`)

  - reference our resources

  - reference other kustomizations

  - add some *patches*

  - ...

- Use that kustomization either with `kustomize build` or `kubectl apply -k`

- Write new kustomizations referencing the first one to handle minor differences

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## A simple kustomization

This features a Deployment, Service, and Ingress (in separate files),
and a couple of patches (to change the number of replicas and the hostname
used in the Ingress).

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
patchesStrategicMerge:
- scale-deployment.yaml
- ingress-hostname.yaml
resources:
- deployment.yaml
- service.yaml
- ingress.yaml
```

On the next slide, let's see a more complex example ...

## Glossary

- A *base* is a kustomization that is referred to by other kustomizations

- An *overlay* is a kustomization that refers to other kustomizations

- A kustomization can be both a base and an overlay at the same time

  (a kustomization can refer to another, which can refer to a third)

- A *patch* describes how to alter an existing resource

  (e.g. to change the image in a Deployment; or scaling parameters; etc.)

- A *variant* is the final outcome of applying bases + overlays

(See the [kustomize glossary](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/docs/glossary.md) for more definitions!)

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## What Kustomize *cannot* do

- By design, there are a number of things that Kustomize won't do

- For instance:

  - using command-line arguments or environment variables to generate a variant

  - overlays can only *add* resources, not *remove* them

- See the full list of [eschewed features](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/docs/eschewedFeatures.md) for more details

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Kustomize workflows

- The Kustomize documentation proposes two different workflows

- *Bespoke configuration*

   - base and overlays managed by the same team

- *Off-the-shelf configuration* (OTS)

  - base and overlays managed by different teams

  - base is regularly updated by "upstream" (e.g. a vendor)

  - our overlays and patches should (hopefully!) apply cleanly

  - we may regularly update the base, or use a remote base

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Remote bases

- Kustomize can also use bases that are remote git repositories

- Examples:

  github.com/jpetazzo/kubercoins (remote git repository)

  github.com/jpetazzo/kubercoins?ref=kustomize (specific tag or branch)

- Note that this only works for kustomizations, not individual resources

  (the specified repository or directory must contain a `kustomization.yaml` file)

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Hashicorp go-getter

- Some versions of Kustomize support additional forms for remote resources

- Examples:

  https://releases.hello.io/k/1.0.zip (remote archive)

  https://releases.hello.io/k/1.0.zip//some-subdir (subdirectory in archive)

- This relies on [hashicorp/go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter#url-format)

- ... But it prevents Kustomize inclusion in `kubectl`

- Avoid them!

- See [kustomize#3578](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/issues/3578) for details

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Managing `kustomization.yaml`

- There are many ways to manage `kustomization.yaml` files, including:

  - web wizards like [Replicated Ship](https://www.replicated.com/ship/)

  - the `kustomize` CLI

  - opening the file with our favorite text editor

- Let's see these in action!

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## An easy way to get started with Kustomize

- We are going to use [Replicated Ship](https://www.replicated.com/ship/) to experiment with Kustomize

- The [Replicated Ship CLI](https://github.com/replicatedhq/ship/releases) has been installed on our clusters

- Replicated Ship has multiple workflows; here is what we will do:

  - initialize a Kustomize overlay from a remote GitHub repository

  - customize some values using the web UI provided by Ship

  - look at the resulting files and apply them to the cluster

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Getting started with Ship

- We need to run `ship init` in a new directory

- `ship init` requires a URL to a remote repository containing Kubernetes YAML

- It will clone that repository and start a web UI

- Later, it can watch that repository and/or update from it

- We will use the [jpetazzo/kubercoins](https://github.com/jpetazzo/kubercoins) repository

  (it contains all the DockerCoins resources as YAML files)

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## `ship init`

.lab[

- Change to a new directory:
  ```bash
  mkdir ~/kustomcoins
  cd ~/kustomcoins
  ```

- Run `ship init` with the kustomcoins repository:
  ```bash
  ship init https://github.com/jpetazzo/kubercoins
  ```

<!-- ```wait Open browser``` -->

]

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Access the web UI

- `ship init` tells us to connect on `localhost:8800`

- We need to replace `localhost` with the address of our node

  (since we run on a remote machine)

- Follow the steps in the web UI, and change one parameter

  (e.g. set the number of replicas in the worker Deployment)

- Complete the web workflow, and go back to the CLI

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Inspect the results

- Look at the content of our directory

- `base` contains the kubercoins repository + a `kustomization.yaml` file

- `overlays/ship` contains the Kustomize overlay referencing the base + our patch(es)

- `rendered.yaml` is a YAML bundle containing the patched application

- `.ship` contains a state file used by Ship

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Using the results

- We can `kubectl apply -f rendered.yaml`

  (on any version of Kubernetes)

- Starting with Kubernetes 1.14, we can apply the overlay directly with:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -k overlays/ship
  ```

- But let's not do that for now!

- We will create a new copy of DockerCoins in another namespace

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Deploy DockerCoins with Kustomize

.lab[

- Create a new namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace kustomcoins
  ```

- Deploy DockerCoins:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f rendered.yaml --namespace=kustomcoins
  ```

- Or, with Kubernetes 1.14, we can also do this:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -k overlays/ship --namespace=kustomcoins
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Checking our new copy of DockerCoins

- We can check the worker logs, or the web UI

.lab[

- Retrieve the NodePort number of the web UI:
  ```bash
  kubectl get service webui --namespace=kustomcoins
  ```

- Open it in a web browser

- Look at the worker logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/worker --tail=10 --follow --namespace=kustomcoins
  ```

<!--
```wait units of work done``` 
```key ^C```
-->

]

Note: it might take a minute or two for the worker to start.

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Working with the `kustomize` CLI

- This is another way to get started

- General workflow:

  `kustomize create` to generate an empty `kustomization.yaml` file

  `kustomize edit add resource` to add Kubernetes YAML files to it

  `kustomize edit add patch` to add patches to said resources

  `kustomize build | kubectl apply -f-` or `kubectl apply -k .`

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## `kubectl` integration

- Kustomize has been integrated in `kubectl` (since Kubernetes 1.14)

  - `kubectl kustomize` can apply a kustomization

  - commands that use `-f` can also use `-k` (`kubectl apply`/`delete`/...)

- The `kustomize` tool is still needed if we want to use `create`, `edit`, ...

- Kubernetes 1.14 to 1.20 uses Kustomize 2.0.3

- Kubernetes 1.21 jumps to Kustomize 4.1.2

- Future versions should track Kustomize updates more closely

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Differences between 2.0.3 and later

- Kustomize 2.1 / 3.0 deprecates `bases` (they should be listed in `resources`)

  (this means that "modern" `kustomize edit add resource` won't work with "old" `kubectl apply -k`)

- Kustomize 2.1 introduces `replicas` and `envs`

- Kustomize 3.1 introduces multipatches

- Kustomize 3.2 introduce inline patches in `kustomization.yaml`

- Kustomize 3.3 to 3.10 is mostly internal refactoring

- Kustomize 4.0 drops go-getter again

- Kustomize 4.1 allows patching kind and name

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Scaling

Instead of using a patch, scaling can be done like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
...
replicas:
- name: worker
  count: 5
```

It will automatically work with Deployments, ReplicaSets, StatefulSets.

(For other resource types, fall back to a patch.)

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Updating images

Instead of using patches, images can be changed like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
...
images:
- name: postgres
  newName: harbor.enix.io/my-postgres
- name: dockercoins/worker
  newTag: v0.2
- name: dockercoins/hasher
  newName: registry.dockercoins.io/hasher
  newTag: v0.2
- name: alpine
  digest: sha256:24a0c4b4a4c0eb97a1aabb8e29f18e917d05abfe1b7a7c07857230879ce7d3d3
```

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Updating images, pros and cons

- Very convenient when the same image appears multiple times

- Very convenient to define tags (or pin to hashes) outside of the main YAML

- Doesn't support wildcard or generic substitutions:

  - cannot "replace `dockercoins/*` with `ghcr.io/dockercoins/*`"

  - cannot "tag all `dockercoins/*` with `v0.2`"

- Only patches "well-known" image fields (won't work with CRDs referencing images)

- Helm can deal with these scenarios, for instance:
  ```yaml
  image: {{ .Values.registry }}/worker:{{ .Values.version }}
  ```

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Advanced resource patching

The example below shows how to:

- patch multiple resources with a selector (new in Kustomize 3.1)
- use an inline patch instead of a separate patch file (new in Kustomize 3.2)

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
...
patches:
- patch: |-
    - op: replace
      path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/image
      value: alpine
  target:
    kind: Deployment
    labelSelector: "app"
```

(This replaces all images of Deployments matching the `app` selector with `alpine`.)

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Advanced resource patching, pros and cons

- Very convenient to patch an arbitrary number of resources

- Very convenient to patch any kind of resource, including CRDs

- Doesn't support "fine-grained" patching (e.g. image registry or tag)

- Once again, Helm can do it:
  ```yaml
  image: {{ .Values.registry }}/worker:{{ .Values.version }}
  ```

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Differences with Helm

- Helm charts generally require more upfront work

  (while kustomize "bases" are standard Kubernetes YAML)

- ... But Helm charts are also more powerful; their templating language can:

  - conditionally include/exclude resources or blocks within resources

  - generate values by concatenating, hashing, transforming parameters

  - generate values or resources by iteration (`{{ range ... }}`)

  - access the Kubernetes API during template evaluation

  - [and much more](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/)

# Managing stacks with Helm

- Helm is a (kind of!) package manager for Kubernetes

- We can use it to:

  - find existing packages (called "charts") created by other folks

  - install these packages, configuring them for our particular setup

  - package our own things (for distribution or for internal use)

  - manage the lifecycle of these installs (rollback to previous version etc.)

- It's a "CNCF graduate project", indicating a certain level of maturity

  (more on that later)

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

## From `kubectl run` to YAML

- We can create resources with one-line commands

  (`kubectl run`, `kubectl create deployment`, `kubectl expose`...)

- We can also create resources by loading YAML files

  (with `kubectl apply -f`, `kubectl create -f`...)

- There can be multiple resources in a single YAML files

  (making them convenient to deploy entire stacks)

- However, these YAML bundles often need to be customized

  (e.g.: number of replicas, image version to use, features to enable...)

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

## Beyond YAML

- Very often, after putting together our first `app.yaml`, we end up with:

  - `app-prod.yaml`

  - `app-staging.yaml`

  - `app-dev.yaml`

  - instructions indicating to users "please tweak this and that in the YAML"

- That's where using something like
  [CUE](https://github.com/cuelang/cue/blob/v0.3.2/doc/tutorial/kubernetes/README.md),
  [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/),
  or [Helm](https://helm.sh/) can help!

- Now we can do something like this:
  ```bash
  helm install app ... --set this.parameter=that.value
  ```

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

## Other features of Helm

- With Helm, we create "charts"

- These charts can be used internally or distributed publicly

- Public charts can be indexed through the [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/)

- This gives us a way to find and install other folks' charts

- Helm also gives us ways to manage the lifecycle of what we install:

  - keep track of what we have installed

  - upgrade versions, change parameters, roll back, uninstall

- Furthermore, even if it's not "the" standard, it's definitely "a" standard!

## CNCF graduation status

- On April 30th 2020, Helm was the 10th project to *graduate* within the CNCF

  üéâ

  (alongside Containerd, Prometheus, and Kubernetes itself)

- This is an acknowledgement by the CNCF for projects that

  *demonstrate thriving adoption, an open governance process,
  <br/>
  and a strong commitment to community, sustainability, and inclusivity.*

- See [CNCF announcement](https://www.cncf.io/announcement/2020/04/30/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-helm-graduation/)
  and [Helm announcement](https://helm.sh/blog/celebrating-helms-cncf-graduation/)

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

## Helm concepts

- `helm` is a CLI tool

- It is used to find, install, upgrade *charts*

- A chart is an archive containing templatized YAML bundles

- Charts are versioned

- Charts can be stored on private or public repositories

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

## Differences between charts and packages

- A package (deb, rpm...) contains binaries, libraries, etc.

- A chart contains YAML manifests

  (the binaries, libraries, etc. are in the images referenced by the chart)

- On most distributions, a package can only be installed once

  (installing another version replaces the installed one)

- A chart can be installed multiple times

- Each installation is called a *release*

- This allows to install e.g. 10 instances of MongoDB

  (with potentially different versions and configurations)

## Wait a minute ...

*But, on my Debian system, I have Python 2 **and** Python 3.
<br/>
Also, I have multiple versions of the Postgres database engine!*

Yes!

But they have different package names:

- `python2.7`, `python3.8`

- `postgresql-10`, `postgresql-11`

Good to know: the Postgres package in Debian includes
provisions to deploy multiple Postgres servers on the
same system, but it's an exception (and it's a lot of
work done by the package maintainer, not by the `dpkg`
or `apt` tools).

## Helm 2 vs Helm 3

- Helm 3 was released [November 13, 2019](https://helm.sh/blog/helm-3-released/)

- Charts remain compatible between Helm 2 and Helm 3

- The CLI is very similar (with minor changes to some commands)

- The main difference is that Helm 2 uses `tiller`, a server-side component

- Helm 3 doesn't use `tiller` at all, making it simpler (yay!)

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## With or without `tiller`

- With Helm 3:

  - the `helm` CLI communicates directly with the Kubernetes API

  - it creates resources (deployments, services...) with our credentials

- With Helm 2:

  - the `helm` CLI communicates with `tiller`, telling `tiller` what to do

  - `tiller` then communicates with the Kubernetes API, using its own credentials

- This indirect model caused significant permissions headaches

  (`tiller` required very broad permissions to function)

- `tiller` was removed in Helm 3 to simplify the security aspects

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

## Installing Helm

- If the `helm` CLI is not installed in your environment, install it

.lab[

- Check if `helm` is installed:
  ```bash
  helm
  ```

- If it's not installed, run the following command:
  ```bash
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 \
  | bash
  ```

]

(To install Helm 2, replace `get-helm-3` with `get`.)

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Only if using Helm 2 ...

- We need to install Tiller and give it some permissions

- Tiller is composed of a *service* and a *deployment* in the `kube-system` namespace

- They can be managed (installed, upgraded...) with the `helm` CLI

.lab[

- Deploy Tiller:
  ```bash
  helm init
  ```

]

At the end of the install process, you will see:

```
Happy Helming!
```

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Only if using Helm 2 ...

- Tiller needs permissions to create Kubernetes resources

- In a more realistic deployment, you might create per-user or per-team
  service accounts, roles, and role bindings

.lab[

- Grant `cluster-admin` role to `kube-system:default` service account:
  ```bash
  kubectl create clusterrolebinding add-on-cluster-admin \
      --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:default
  ```


]

(Defining the exact roles and permissions on your cluster requires
a deeper knowledge of Kubernetes' RBAC model. The command above is
fine for personal and development clusters.)

---

## Charts and repositories

- A *repository* (or repo in short) is a collection of charts

- It's just a bunch of files

  (they can be hosted by a static HTTP server, or on a local directory)

- We can add "repos" to Helm, giving them a nickname

- The nickname is used when referring to charts on that repo

  (for instance, if we try to install `hello/world`, that
  means the chart `world` on the repo `hello`; and that repo
  `hello` might be something like https://blahblah.hello.io/charts/)

## How to find charts, the old way

- Helm 2 came with one pre-configured repo, the "stable" repo

  (located at https://charts.helm.sh/stable)

- Helm 3 doesn't have any pre-configured repo

- The "stable" repo mentioned above is now being deprecated

- The new approach is to have fully decentralized repos

- Repos can be indexed in the Artifact Hub

  (which supersedes the Helm Hub)

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

## How to find charts, the new way

- Go to the [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=0) (https://artifacthub.io)

- Or use `helm search hub ...` from the CLI

- Let's try to find a Helm chart for something called "OWASP Juice Shop"!

  (it is a famous demo app used in security challenges)

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

## Finding charts from the CLI

- We can use `helm search hub <keyword>`

.lab[

- Look for the OWASP Juice Shop app:
  ```bash
  helm search hub owasp juice
  ```

- Since the URLs are truncated, try with the YAML output:
  ```bash
  helm search hub owasp juice -o yaml
  ```

- We can also use the Artifact Hub search feature

.lab[

- Go to https://artifacthub.io/

- In the search box on top, enter "owasp juice"

- Click on the "juice-shop" result (not "multi-juicer" or "juicy-ctf")

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

## Installing the chart

- Click on the "Install" button, it will show instructions

.lab[

- First, add the repository for that chart:
  ```bash
  helm repo add juice https://charts.securecodebox.io
  ```

- Then, install the chart:
  ```bash
  helm install my-juice-shop juice/juice-shop
  ```

]

Note: it is also possible to install directly a chart, with `--repo https://...`

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

## Charts and releases

- "Installing a chart" means creating a *release*

- In the previous example, the release was named "my-juice-shop"

- We can also use `--generate-name` to ask Helm to generate a name for us

.lab[

- List the releases:
  ```bash
  helm list
  ```

- Check that we have a `my-juice-shop-...` Pod up and running:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Searching and installing with Helm 2

- Helm 2 doesn't have support for the Helm Hub

- The `helm search` command only takes a search string argument

  (e.g. `helm search juice-shop`)

- With Helm 2, the name is optional:

  `helm install juice/juice-shop` will automatically generate a name

  `helm install --name my-juice-shop juice/juice-shop` will specify a name

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

## Viewing resources of a release

- This specific chart labels all its resources with a `release` label

- We can use a selector to see these resources

.lab[

- List all the resources created by this release:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all --selector=app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-juice-shop
  ```

]

Note: this label wasn't added automatically by Helm.
<br/>
It is defined in that chart. In other words, not all charts will provide this label.

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

## Configuring a release

- By default, `juice/juice-shop` creates a service of type `ClusterIP`

- We would like to change that to a `NodePort`

- We could use `kubectl edit service my-juice-shop`, but ...

  ... our changes would get overwritten next time we update that chart!

- Instead, we are going to *set a value*

- Values are parameters that the chart can use to change its behavior

- Values have default values

- Each chart is free to define its own values and their defaults

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

## Checking possible values

- We can inspect a chart with `helm show` or `helm inspect`

.lab[

- Look at the README for the app:
  ```bash
  helm show readme juice/juice-shop
  ```

- Look at the values and their defaults:
  ```bash
  helm show values juice/juice-shop
  ```

]

The `values` may or may not have useful comments.

The `readme` may or may not have (accurate) explanations for the values.

(If we're unlucky, there won't be any indication about how to use the values!)

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

## Setting values

- Values can be set when installing a chart, or when upgrading it

- We are going to update `my-juice-shop` to change the type of the service

.lab[

- Update `my-juice-shop`:
  ```bash
  helm upgrade my-juice-shop juice/my-juice-shop \
       --set service.type=NodePort
  ```

]

Note that we have to specify the chart that we use (`juice/my-juice-shop`),
even if we just want to update some values.

We can set multiple values. If we want to set many values, we can use `-f`/`--values` and pass a YAML file with all the values.

All unspecified values will take the default values defined in the chart.

.debug[[k8s/helm-intro.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-intro.md)]
---

## Connecting to the Juice Shop

- Let's check the app that we just installed

.lab[

- Check the node port allocated to the service:
  ```bash
  kubectl get service my-juice-shop
  PORT=$(kubectl get service my-juice-shop -o jsonpath={..nodePort})
  ```

- Connect to it:
  ```bash
  curl localhost:$PORT/
  ```

# Helm chart format

- What exactly is a chart?

- What's in it?

- What would be involved in creating a chart?

  (we won't create a chart, but we'll see the required steps)

.debug[[k8s/helm-chart-format.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-chart-format.md)]
---

## What is a chart

- A chart is a set of files

- Some of these files are mandatory for the chart to be viable

  (more on that later)

- These files are typically packed in a tarball

- These tarballs are stored in "repos"

  (which can be static HTTP servers)

- We can install from a repo, from a local tarball, or an unpacked tarball

  (the latter option is preferred when developing a chart)

.debug[[k8s/helm-chart-format.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-chart-format.md)]
---

## What's in a chart

- A chart must have at least:

  - a `templates` directory, with YAML manifests for Kubernetes resources

  - a `values.yaml` file, containing (tunable) parameters for the chart

  - a `Chart.yaml` file, containing metadata (name, version, description ...)

- Let's look at a simple chart for a basic demo app

.debug[[k8s/helm-chart-format.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-chart-format.md)]
---

## Adding the repo

- If you haven't done it before, you need to add the repo for that chart

.lab[

- Add the repo that holds the chart for the OWASP Juice Shop:
  ```bash
  helm repo add juice https://charts.securecodebox.io
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-chart-format.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-chart-format.md)]
---

## Downloading a chart

- We can use `helm pull` to download a chart from a repo

.lab[

- Download the tarball for `juice/juice-shop`:
  ```bash
  helm pull juice/juice-shop
  ```
  (This will create a file named `juice-shop-X.Y.Z.tgz`.)

- Or, download + untar `juice/juice-shop`:
  ```bash
  helm pull juice/juice-shop --untar
  ```
  (This will create a directory named `juice-shop`.)

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-chart-format.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-chart-format.md)]
---

## Looking at the chart's content

- Let's look at the files and directories in the `juice-shop` chart

.lab[

- Display the tree structure of the chart we just downloaded:
  ```bash
  tree juice-shop
  ```

]

We see the components mentioned above: `Chart.yaml`, `templates/`, `values.yaml`.

.debug[[k8s/helm-chart-format.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-chart-format.md)]
---

## Templates

- The `templates/` directory contains YAML manifests for Kubernetes resources

  (Deployments, Services, etc.)

- These manifests can contain template tags

  (using the standard Go template library)

.lab[

- Look at the template file for the Service resource:
  ```bash
  cat juice-shop/templates/service.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-chart-format.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-chart-format.md)]
---

## Analyzing the template file

- Tags are identified by `{{ ... }}`

- `{{ template "x.y" }}` expands a [named template](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/named_templates/#declaring-and-using-templates-with-define-and-template)

  (previously defined with `{{ define "x.y" }}...stuff...{{ end }}`)

- The `.` in `{{ template "x.y" . }}` is the *context* for that named template

  (so that the named template block can access variables from the local context)

- `{{ .Release.xyz }}` refers to [built-in variables](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/builtin_objects/) initialized by Helm

  (indicating the chart name, version, whether we are installing or upgrading ...)

- `{{ .Values.xyz }}` refers to tunable/settable [values](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/)

  (more on that in a minute)

.debug[[k8s/helm-chart-format.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-chart-format.md)]
---

## Values

- Each chart comes with a
  [values file](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/)

- It's a YAML file containing a set of default parameters for the chart

- The values can be accessed in templates with e.g. `{{ .Values.x.y }}`

  (corresponding to field `y` in map `x` in the values file)

- The values can be set or overridden when installing or ugprading a chart:

  - with `--set x.y=z` (can be used multiple times to set multiple values)

  - with `--values some-yaml-file.yaml` (set a bunch of values from a file)

- Charts following best practices will have values following specific patterns

  (e.g. having a `service` map allowing to set `service.type` etc.)

.debug[[k8s/helm-chart-format.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-chart-format.md)]
---

## Other useful tags

- `{{ if x }} y {{ end }}` allows to include `y` if `x` evaluates to `true`

  (can be used for e.g. healthchecks, annotations, or even an entire resource)

- `{{ range x }} y {{ end }}` iterates over `x`, evaluating `y` each time

  (the elements of `x` are assigned to `.` in the range scope)

- `{{- x }}`/`{{ x -}}` will remove whitespace on the left/right

- The whole [Sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) library, with additions:

  `lower` `upper` `quote` `trim` `default` `b64enc` `b64dec` `sha256sum` `indent` `toYaml` ...

.debug[[k8s/helm-chart-format.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-chart-format.md)]
---

## Pipelines

- `{{ quote blah }}` can also be expressed as `{{ blah | quote }}`

- With multiple arguments, `{{ x y z }}` can be expressed as `{{ z | x y }}`)

- Example: `{{ .Values.annotations | toYaml | indent 4 }}`

  - transforms the map under `annotations` into a YAML string

  - indents it with 4 spaces (to match the surrounding context)

- Pipelines are not specific to Helm, but a feature of Go templates

  (check the [Go text/template documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) for more details and examples)

.debug[[k8s/helm-chart-format.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-chart-format.md)]
---

## README and NOTES.txt

- At the top-level of the chart, it's a good idea to have a README

- It will be viewable with e.g. `helm show readme juice/juice-shop`

- In the `templates/` directory, we can also have a `NOTES.txt` file

- When the template is installed (or upgraded), `NOTES.txt` is processed too

  (i.e. its `{{ ... }}` tags are evaluated)

- It gets displayed after the install or upgrade

- It's a great place to generate messages to tell the user:

  - how to connect to the release they just deployed

  - any passwords or other thing that we generated for them

.debug[[k8s/helm-chart-format.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-chart-format.md)]
---

## Additional files

- We can place arbitrary files in the chart (outside of the `templates/` directory)

- They can be accessed in templates with `.Files`

- They can be transformed into ConfigMaps or Secrets with `AsConfig` and `AsSecrets`

  (see [this example](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/accessing_files/#configmap-and-secrets-utility-functions) in the Helm docs)

.debug[[k8s/helm-chart-format.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-chart-format.md)]
---

## Hooks and tests

- We can define *hooks* in our templates

- Hooks are resources annotated with `"helm.sh/hook": NAME-OF-HOOK`

- Hook names include `pre-install`, `post-install`, `test`, [and much more](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/#the-available-hooks)

- The resources defined in hooks are loaded at a specific time

- Hook execution is *synchronous*

  (if the resource is a Job or Pod, Helm will wait for its completion)

- This can be use for database migrations, backups, notifications, smoke tests ...

- Hooks named `test` are executed only when running `helm test RELEASE-NAME`

# Creating a basic chart

- We are going to show a way to create a *very simplified* chart

- In a real chart, *lots of things* would be templatized

  (Resource names, service types, number of replicas...)

.lab[

- Create a sample chart:
  ```bash
  helm create dockercoins
  ```

- Move away the sample templates and create an empty template directory:
  ```bash
  mv dockercoins/templates dockercoins/default-templates
  mkdir dockercoins/templates
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md)]
---

## Adding the manifests of our app

- There is a convenient `dockercoins.yml` in the repo

.lab[

- Copy the YAML file to the `templates` subdirectory in the chart:
  ```bash
  cp ~/container.training/k8s/dockercoins.yaml dockercoins/templates
  ```

]

- Note: it is probably easier to have multiple YAML files

  (rather than a single, big file with all the manifests)

- But that works too!

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md)]
---

## Testing our Helm chart

- Our Helm chart is now ready

  (as surprising as it might seem!)

.lab[

- Let's try to install the chart:
  ```
  helm install helmcoins dockercoins
  ```
  (`helmcoins` is the name of the release; `dockercoins` is the local path of the chart)

]

--

- If the application is already deployed, this will fail:
```
Error: rendered manifests contain a resource that already exists.
Unable to continue with install: existing resource conflict:
kind: Service, namespace: default, name: hasher
```

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md)]
---

## Switching to another namespace

- If there is already a copy of dockercoins in the current namespace:

  - we can switch with `kubens` or `kubectl config set-context`

  - we can also tell Helm to use a different namespace

.lab[

- Create a new namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace helmcoins
  ```

- Deploy our chart in that namespace:
  ```bash
  helm install helmcoins dockercoins --namespace=helmcoins
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md)]
---

## Helm releases are namespaced

- Let's try to see the release that we just deployed

.lab[

- List Helm releases:
  ```bash
  helm list
  ```

]

Our release doesn't show up!

We have to specify its namespace (or switch to that namespace).

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md)]
---

## Specifying the namespace

- Try again, with the correct namespace

.lab[

- List Helm releases in `helmcoins`:
  ```bash
  helm list --namespace=helmcoins
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md)]
---

## Checking our new copy of DockerCoins

- We can check the worker logs, or the web UI

.lab[

- Retrieve the NodePort number of the web UI:
  ```bash
  kubectl get service webui --namespace=helmcoins
  ```

- Open it in a web browser

- Look at the worker logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/worker --tail=10 --follow --namespace=helmcoins
  ```

]

Note: it might take a minute or two for the worker to start.

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md)]
---

## Discussion, shortcomings

- Helm (and Kubernetes) best practices recommend to add a number of annotations

  (e.g. `app.kubernetes.io/name`, `helm.sh/chart`, `app.kubernetes.io/instance` ...)

- Our basic chart doesn't have any of these

- Our basic chart doesn't use any template tag

- Does it make sense to use Helm in that case?

- *Yes,* because Helm will:

  - track the resources created by the chart

  - save successive revisions, allowing us to rollback

[Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_best_practices/labels/)
and [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/)
have details about recommended annotations and labels.

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md)]
---

## Cleaning up

- Let's remove that chart before moving on

.lab[

- Delete the release (don't forget to specify the namespace):
  ```bash
  helm delete helmcoins --namespace=helmcoins
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md)]
---

## Tips when writing charts

- It is not necessary to `helm install`/`upgrade` to test a chart

- If we just want to look at the generated YAML, use `helm template`:
  ```bash
  helm template ./my-chart
  helm template release-name ./my-chart
  ```

- Of course, we can use `--set` and `--values` too

- Note that this won't fully validate the YAML!

  (e.g. if there is `apiVersion: klingon` it won't complain)

- This can be used when trying things out

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-basic-chart.md)]
---

## Exploring the templating system

Try to put something like this in a file in the `templates` directory:

```yaml
hello: {{ .Values.service.port }}
comment: {{/* something completely.invalid !!!  */}}
type: {{ .Values.service | typeOf | printf }}
### print complex value
{{ .Values.service | toYaml }}
### indent it
indented:
{{ .Values.service | toYaml | indent 2 }}
```

Then run `helm template`.

The result is not a valid YAML manifest, but this is a great debugging tool!

# Creating better Helm charts

- We are going to create a chart with the helper `helm create`

- This will give us a chart implementing lots of Helm best practices

  (labels, annotations, structure of the `values.yaml` file ...)

- We will use that chart as a generic Helm chart

- We will use it to deploy DockerCoins

- Each component of DockerCoins will have its own *release*

- In other words, we will "install" that Helm chart multiple times

  (one time per component of DockerCoins)

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Creating a generic chart

- Rather than starting from scratch, we will use `helm create`

- This will give us a basic chart that we will customize

.lab[

- Create a basic chart:
  ```bash
  cd ~
  helm create helmcoins
  ```

]

This creates a basic chart in the directory `helmcoins`.

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## What's in the basic chart?

- The basic chart will create a Deployment and a Service

- Optionally, it will also include an Ingress

- If we don't pass any values, it will deploy the `nginx` image

- We can override many things in that chart

- Let's try to deploy DockerCoins components with that chart!

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Writing `values.yaml` for our components

- We need to write one `values.yaml` file for each component

  (hasher, redis, rng, webui, worker)

- We will start with the `values.yaml` of the chart, and remove what we don't need

- We will create 5 files:

  hasher.yaml, redis.yaml, rng.yaml, webui.yaml, worker.yaml

- In each file, we want to have:
  ```yaml
    image:
      repository: IMAGE-REPOSITORY-NAME
      tag: IMAGE-TAG
  ```

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Getting started

- For component X, we want to use the image dockercoins/X:v0.1

  (for instance, for rng, we want to use the image dockercoins/rng:v0.1)

- Exception: for redis, we want to use the official image redis:latest

.lab[

- Write YAML files for the 5 components, with the following model:
  ```yaml
    image:
      repository: `IMAGE-REPOSITORY-NAME` (e.g. dockercoins/worker)
      tag: `IMAGE-TAG` (e.g. v0.1)
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Deploying DockerCoins components

- For convenience, let's work in a separate namespace

.lab[

- Create a new namespace (if it doesn't already exist):
  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace helmcoins
  ```

- Switch to that namespace:
  ```bash
  kns helmcoins
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Deploying the chart

- To install a chart, we can use the following command:
  ```bash
  helm install COMPONENT-NAME CHART-DIRECTORY
  ```

- We can also use the following command, which is *idempotent*:
  ```bash
  helm upgrade COMPONENT-NAME CHART-DIRECTORY --install
  ```

.lab[

- Install the 5 components of DockerCoins:
  ```bash
    for COMPONENT in hasher redis rng webui worker; do
      helm upgrade $COMPONENT helmcoins --install --values=$COMPONENT.yaml
    done

## "Idempotent"

- Idempotent = that can be applied multiple times without changing the result

  (the word is commonly used in maths and computer science)

- In this context, this means:

  - if the action (installing the chart) wasn't done, do it

  - if the action was already done, don't do anything

- Ideally, when such an action fails, it can be retried safely

  (as opposed to, e.g., installing a new release each time we run it)

- Other example: `kubectl -f some-file.yaml`

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Checking what we've done

- Let's see if DockerCoins is working!

.lab[

- Check the logs of the worker:
  ```bash
  stern worker
  ```

- Look at the resources that were created:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

There are *many* issues to fix!

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Can't pull image

- It looks like our images can't be found

.lab[

- Use `kubectl describe` on any of the pods in error

]

- We're trying to pull `rng:1.16.0` instead of `rng:v0.1`!

- Where does that `1.16.0` tag come from?

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Inspecting our template

- Let's look at the `templates/` directory

  (and try to find the one generating the Deployment resource)

.lab[

- Show the structure of the `helmcoins` chart that Helm generated:
  ```bash
  tree helmcoins
  ```

- Check the file `helmcoins/templates/deployment.yaml`

- Look for the `image:` parameter

]

*The image tag references `{{ .Chart.AppVersion }}`. Where does that come from?*

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## The `.Chart` variable

- `.Chart` is a map corresponding to the values in `Chart.yaml`

- Let's look for `AppVersion` there!

.lab[

- Check the file `helmcoins/Chart.yaml`

- Look for the `appVersion:` parameter

]

(Yes, the case is different between the template and the Chart file.)

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Using the correct tags

- If we change `AppVersion` to `v0.1`, it will change for *all* deployments

  (including redis)

- Instead, let's change the *template* to use `{{ .Values.image.tag }}`

  (to match what we've specified in our values YAML files)

.lab[

- Edit `helmcoins/templates/deployment.yaml`

- Replace `{{ .Chart.AppVersion }}` with `{{ .Values.image.tag }}`

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Upgrading to use the new template

- Technically, we just made a new version of the *chart*

- To use the new template, we need to *upgrade* the release to use that chart

.lab[

- Upgrade all components:
  ```bash
    for COMPONENT in hasher redis rng webui worker; do
      helm upgrade $COMPONENT helmcoins
    done
  ```

- Check how our pods are doing:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

We should see all pods "Running". But ... not all of them are READY.

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Troubleshooting readiness

- `hasher`, `rng`, `webui` should show up as `1/1 READY`

- But `redis` and `worker` should show up as `0/1 READY`

- Why?

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Troubleshooting pods

- The easiest way to troubleshoot pods is to look at *events*

- We can look at all the events on the cluster (with `kubectl get events`)

- Or we can use `kubectl describe` on the objects that have problems

  (`kubectl describe` will retrieve the events related to the object)

.lab[

- Check the events for the redis pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=redis
  ```

]

It's failing both its liveness and readiness probes!

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Healthchecks

- The default chart defines healthchecks doing HTTP requests on port 80

- That won't work for redis and worker

  (redis is not HTTP, and not on port 80; worker doesn't even listen)

--

- We could remove or comment out the healthchecks

- We could also make them conditional

- This sounds more interesting, let's do that!

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Conditionals

- We need to enclose the healthcheck block with:

  `{{ if false }}` at the beginning (we can change the condition later)

  `{{ end }}` at the end

.lab[

- Edit `helmcoins/templates/deployment.yaml`

- Add `{{ if false }}` on the line before `livenessProbe`

- Add `{{ end }}` after the `readinessProbe` section

  (see next slide for details)

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

This is what the new YAML should look like (added lines in yellow):

```yaml
        ports:
          - name: http
            containerPort: 80
            protocol: TCP
        `{{ if false }}`
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: http
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: http
        `{{ end }}`
        resources:
          {{- toYaml .Values.resources | nindent 12 }}
```

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Testing the new chart

- We need to upgrade all the services again to use the new chart

.lab[

- Upgrade all components:
  ```bash
    for COMPONENT in hasher redis rng webui worker; do
      helm upgrade $COMPONENT helmcoins
    done
  ```

- Check how our pods are doing:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

Everything should now be running!

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## What's next?

- Is this working now?

.lab[

- Let's check the logs of the worker:
  ```bash
  stern worker
  ```

]

This error might look familiar ... The worker can't resolve `redis`.

Typically, that error means that the `redis` service doesn't exist.

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Checking services

- What about the services created by our chart?

.lab[

- Check the list of services:
  ```bash
  kubectl get services
  ```

]

They are named `COMPONENT-helmcoins` instead of just `COMPONENT`.

We need to change that!

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Where do the service names come from?

- Look at the YAML template used for the services

- It should be using `{{ include "helmcoins.fullname" }}`

- `include` indicates a *template block* defined somewhere else

.lab[

- Find where that `fullname` thing is defined:
  ```bash
  grep define.*fullname helmcoins/templates/*
  ```

]

It should be in `_helpers.tpl`.

We can look at the definition, but it's fairly complex ...

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Changing service names

- Instead of that `{{ include }}` tag, let's use the name of the release

- The name of the release is available as `{{ .Release.Name }}`

.lab[

- Edit `helmcoins/templates/service.yaml`

- Replace the service name with `{{ .Release.Name }}`

- Upgrade all the releases to use the new chart

- Confirm that the services now have the right names

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Is it working now?

- If we look at the worker logs, it appears that the worker is still stuck

- What could be happening?

--

- The redis service is not on port 80!

- Let's see how the port number is set

- We need to look at both the *deployment* template and the *service* template

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Service template

- In the service template, we have the following section:
  ```yaml
    ports:
    - port: {{ .Values.service.port }}
      targetPort: http
      protocol: TCP
      name: http
  ```

- `port` is the port on which the service is "listening"

  (i.e. to which our code needs to connect)

- `targetPort` is the port on which the pods are listening

- The `name` is not important (it's OK if it's `http` even for non-HTTP traffic)

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Setting the redis port

- Let's add a `service.port` value to the redis release

.lab[

- Edit `redis.yaml` to add:
  ```yaml
    service:
      port: 6379
  ```

- Apply the new values file:
  ```bash
  helm upgrade redis helmcoins --values=redis.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Deployment template

- If we look at the deployment template, we see this section:
  ```yaml
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 80
              protocol: TCP
  ```

- The container port is hard-coded to 80

- We'll change it to use the port number specified in the values

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Changing the deployment template

.lab[  

- Edit `helmcoins/templates/deployment.yaml`

- The line with `containerPort` should be:
  ```yaml
  containerPort: {{ .Values.service.port }}
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Apply changes

- Re-run the for loop to execute `helm upgrade` one more time

- Check the worker logs

- This time, it should be working!

.debug[[k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-create-better-chart.md)]
---

## Extra steps

- We don't need to create a service for the worker

- We can put the whole service block in a conditional

  (this will require additional changes in other files referencing the service)

- We can set the webui to be a NodePort service

- We can change the number of workers with `replicaCount`

- And much more!

# Charts using other charts

- Helm charts can have *dependencies* on other charts

- These dependencies will help us to share or reuse components

  (so that we write and maintain less manifests, less templates, less code!)

- As an example, we will use a community chart for Redis

- This will help people who write charts, and people who use them

- ... And potentially remove a lot of code! ‚úåÔ∏è

.debug[[k8s/helm-dependencies.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-dependencies.md)]
---

## Redis in DockerCoins

- In the DockerCoins demo app, we have 5 components:

  - 2 internal webservices
  - 1 worker
  - 1 public web UI
  - 1 Redis data store

- Every component is running some custom code, except Redis

- Every component is using a custom image, except Redis

  (which is using the official `redis` image)

- Could we use a standard chart for Redis?

- Yes! Dependencies to the rescue!

.debug[[k8s/helm-dependencies.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-dependencies.md)]
---

## Adding our dependency

- First, we will add the dependency to the `Chart.yaml` file

- Then, we will ask Helm to download that dependency

- We will also *lock* the dependency

  (lock it to a specific version, to ensure reproducibility)

.debug[[k8s/helm-dependencies.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-dependencies.md)]
---

## Declaring the dependency

- First, let's edit `Chart.yaml`

.lab[

- In `Chart.yaml`, fill the `dependencies` section:
  ```yaml
    dependencies:
      - name: redis
        version: 11.0.5
        repository: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
        condition: redis.enabled
  ```

]

Where do that `repository` and `version` come from?

We're assuming here that we did our reserach,
or that our resident Helm expert advised us to
use Bitnami's Redis chart.

.debug[[k8s/helm-dependencies.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-dependencies.md)]
---

## Conditions

- The `condition` field gives us a way to enable/disable the dependency:
  ```yaml
  conditions: redis.enabled
  ```

- Here, we can disable Redis with the Helm flag `--set redis.enabled=false`

  (or set that value in a `values.yaml` file)

- Of course, this is mostly useful for *optional* dependencies

  (otherwise, the app ends up being broken since it'll miss a component)

.debug[[k8s/helm-dependencies.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-dependencies.md)]
---

## Lock & Load!

- After adding the dependency, we ask Helm to pin an download it

.lab[

- Ask Helm:
  ```bash
  helm dependency update
  ```

  (Or `helm dep up`)

]

- This wil create `Chart.lock` and fetch the dependency

.debug[[k8s/helm-dependencies.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-dependencies.md)]
---

## What's `Chart.lock`?

- This is a common pattern with dependencies

  (see also: `Gemfile.lock`, `package.json.lock`, and many others)

- This lets us define loose dependencies in `Chart.yaml`

  (e.g. "version 11.whatever, but below 12")

- But have the exact version used in `Chart.lock`

- This ensures reproducible deployments

- `Chart.lock` can (should!) be added to our source tree

- `Chart.lock` can (should!) regularly be updated

.debug[[k8s/helm-dependencies.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-dependencies.md)]
---

## Loose dependencies

- Here is an example of loose version requirement:
  ```yaml
    dependencies:
      - name: redis
        version: ">=11, <12"
        repository: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
  ```

- This makes sure that we have the most recent version in the 11.x train

- ... But without upgrading to version 12.x

  (because it might be incompatible)

.debug[[k8s/helm-dependencies.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-dependencies.md)]
---

## `build` vs `update`

- Helm actually offers two commands to manage dependencies:

  `helm dependency build` = fetch dependencies listed in `Chart.lock`

  `helm dependency update` = update `Chart.lock` (and run `build`)

- When the dependency gets updated, we can/should:

  - `helm dep up` (update `Chart.lock` and fetch new chart)

  - test!

  - if everything is fine, `git add Chart.lock` and commit

.debug[[k8s/helm-dependencies.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-dependencies.md)]
---

## Where are my dependencies?

- Dependencies are downloaded to the `charts/` subdirectory

- When they're downloaded, they stay in compressed format (`.tgz`)

- Should we commit them to our code repository?

- Pros:

  - more resilient to internet/mirror failures/decomissioning

- Cons:

  - can add a lot of weight to the repo if charts are big or change often

  - this can be solved by extra tools like git-lfs

.debug[[k8s/helm-dependencies.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-dependencies.md)]
---

## Dependency tuning

- DockerCoins expects the `redis` Service to be named `redis`

- Our Redis chart uses a different Service name by default

- Service name is `{{ template "redis.fullname" . }}-master`

- `redis.fullname` looks like this:
  ```
    {{- define "redis.fullname" -}}
    {{- if .Values.fullnameOverride -}}
    {{- .Values.fullnameOverride | trunc 63 | trimSuffix "-" -}}
    {{- else -}}
    [...]
    {{- end }}
    {{- end }}
  ```

- How do we fix this?

.debug[[k8s/helm-dependencies.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-dependencies.md)]
---

## Setting dependency variables

- If we set `fullnameOverride` to `redis`:

  - the `{{ template ... }}` block will output `redis`

  - the Service name will be `redis-master`

- A parent chart can set values for its dependencies

- For example, in the parent's `values.yaml`:

  ```yaml
    redis:                    # Name of the dependency
      fullnameOverride: redis # Value passed to redis
      cluster:                # Other values passed to redis
        enabled: false
  ```

- User can also set variables with `--set=` or with `--values=`

.debug[[k8s/helm-dependencies.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-dependencies.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Passing templates

- We can even pass template `{{ include "template.name" }}`, but warning:

   - need to be evaluated with the `tpl` function, on the child side

   - evaluated in the context of the child, with no access to parent variables

<!-- FIXME this probably deserves an example, but I can't imagine one right now üòÖ -->

.debug[[k8s/helm-dependencies.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-dependencies.md)]
---

## Getting rid of the `-master`

- Even if we set that `fullnameOverride`, the Service name will be `redis-master`

- To remove the `-master` suffix, we need to edit the chart itself

- To edit the Redis chart, we need to *embed* it in our own chart

- We need to:

  - decompress the chart

  - adjust `Chart.yaml` accordingly

.debug[[k8s/helm-dependencies.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-dependencies.md)]
---

## Embedding a dependency

.lab[

- Decompress the chart:
  ```yaml
  cd charts
  tar zxf redis-*.tgz
  cd ..
  ```

- Edit `Chart.yaml` and update the `dependencies` section:
  ```yaml
    dependencies:
      - name: redis
        version: '*' # No need to constraint version, from local files
  ```

- Run `helm dep update`

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-dependencies.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-dependencies.md)]
---

## Updating the dependency

- Now we can edit the Service name

  (it should be in `charts/redis/templates/redis-master-svc.yaml`)

- Then try to deploy the whole chart!

.debug[[k8s/helm-dependencies.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-dependencies.md)]
---

## Embedding a dependency multiple times

- What if we need multiple copies of the same subchart?

  (for instance, if we need two completely different Redis servers)

- We can declare a dependency multiple times, and specify an `alias`:
  ```yaml
  dependencies:
    - name: redis
      version: '*'
      alias: querycache
    - name: redis
      version: '*'
      alias: celeryqueue
  ```

- `.Chart.Name` will be set to the `alias`

.debug[[k8s/helm-dependencies.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-dependencies.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Compatibility with Helm 2

- Chart `apiVersion: v1` is the only version supported by Helm 2

- Chart v1 is also supported by Helm 3

- Use v1 if you want to be compatible with Helm 2

- Instead of `Chart.yaml`, dependencies are defined in `requirements.yaml`

  (and we should commit `requirements.lock` instead of `Chart.lock`)

# Helm and invalid values

- A lot of Helm charts let us specify an image tag like this:
  ```bash
  helm install ... --set image.tag=v1.0
  ```

- What happens if we make a small mistake, like this:
  ```bash
  helm install ... --set imagetag=v1.0
  ```

- Or even, like this:
  ```bash
  helm install ... --set image=v1.0
  ```

ü§î

.debug[[k8s/helm-values-schema-validation.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-values-schema-validation.md)]
---

## Making mistakes

- In the first case:

  - we set `imagetag=v1.0` instead of `image.tag=v1.0`

  - Helm will ignore that value (if it's not used anywhere in templates)

  - the chart is deployed with the default value instead

- In the second case:

  - we set `image=v1.0` instead of `image.tag=v1.0`

  - `image` will be a string instead of an object

  - Helm will *probably* fail when trying to evaluate `image.tag`

.debug[[k8s/helm-values-schema-validation.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-values-schema-validation.md)]
---

## Preventing mistakes

- To prevent the first mistake, we need to tell Helm:

  *"let me know if any additional (unknown) value was set!"*

- To prevent the second mistake, we need to tell Helm:

  *"`image` should be an object, and `image.tag` should be a string!"*

- We can do this with *values schema validation*

.debug[[k8s/helm-values-schema-validation.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-values-schema-validation.md)]
---

## Helm values schema validation

- We can write a spec representing the possible values accepted by the chart

- Helm will check the validity of the values before trying to install/upgrade

- If it finds problems, it will stop immediately

- The spec uses [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/):

  *JSON Schema is a vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.*

- JSON Schema is designed for JSON, but can easily work with YAML too

  (or any language with `map|dict|associativearray` and `list|array|sequence|tuple`)

.debug[[k8s/helm-values-schema-validation.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-values-schema-validation.md)]
---

## In practice

- We need to put the JSON Schema spec in a file called `values.schema.json`

  (at the root of our chart; right next to `values.yaml` etc.)

- The file is optional

- We don't need to register or declare it in `Chart.yaml` or anywhere

- Let's write a schema that will verify that ...

  - `image.repository` is an official image (string without slashes or dots)

  - `image.pullPolicy` can only be `Always`, `Never`, `IfNotPresent`

.debug[[k8s/helm-values-schema-validation.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-values-schema-validation.md)]
---

## `values.schema.json`

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "image": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "repository": {
          "type": "string",
          "pattern": "^[a-z0-9-_]+$"
        },
        "pullPolicy": {
          "type": "string",
          "pattern": "^(Always|Never|IfNotPresent)$"
        }
      } 
    } 
  } 
}
```

.debug[[k8s/helm-values-schema-validation.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-values-schema-validation.md)]
---

## Testing our schema

- Let's try to install a couple releases with that schema!

.lab[

- Try an invalid `pullPolicy`:
  ```bash
  helm install broken --set image.pullPolicy=ShallNotPass
  ```

- Try an invalid value:
  ```bash
  helm install should-break --set ImAgeTAg=toto
  ```

]

- The first one fails, but the second one still passes ...

- Why?

.debug[[k8s/helm-values-schema-validation.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-values-schema-validation.md)]
---

## Bailing out on unkown properties

- We told Helm what properties (values) were valid

- We didn't say what to do about additional (unknown) properties!

- We can fix that with `"additionalProperties": false`

.lab[

- Edit `values.schema.json` to add `"additionalProperties": false`
  ```json
    {
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/schema#",
      "type": "object",
      "additionalProperties": false,
      "properties": {
      ...
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-values-schema-validation.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-values-schema-validation.md)]
---

## Testing with unknown properties

.lab[

- Try to pass an extra property:
  ```bash
  helm install should-break --set ImAgeTAg=toto
  ```

- Try to pass an extra nested property:
  ```bash
  helm install does-it-work --set image.hello=world
  ```

]

The first command should break.

The second will not.

`"additionalProperties": false` needs to be specified at each level.

# Helm secrets

- Helm can do *rollbacks*:

  - to previously installed charts

  - to previous sets of values

- How and where does it store the data needed to do that?

- Let's investigate!

.debug[[k8s/helm-secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-secrets.md)]
---

## Adding the repo

- If you haven't done it before, you need to add the repo for that chart

.lab[

- Add the repo that holds the chart for the OWASP Juice Shop:
  ```bash
  helm repo add juice https://charts.securecodebox.io
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-secrets.md)]
---

## We need a release

- We need to install something with Helm

- Let's use the `juice/juice-shop` chart as an example

.lab[

- Install a release called `orange` with the chart `juice/juice-shop`:
  ```bash
  helm upgrade orange juice/juice-shop --install
  ```

- Let's upgrade that release, and change a value:
  ```bash
  helm upgrade orange juice/juice-shop --set ingress.enabled=true
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/helm-secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-secrets.md)]
---

## Release history

- Helm stores successive revisions of each release

.lab[

- View the history for that release:
  ```bash
  helm history orange
  ```

]

Where does that come from?

.debug[[k8s/helm-secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-secrets.md)]
---

## Investigate

- Possible options:

  - local filesystem (no, because history is visible from other machines)

  - persistent volumes (no, Helm works even without them)

  - ConfigMaps, Secrets?

.lab[

- Look for ConfigMaps and Secrets:
  ```bash
  kubectl get configmaps,secrets
  ```

]

--

We should see a number of secrets with TYPE `helm.sh/release.v1`.

.debug[[k8s/helm-secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-secrets.md)]
---

## Unpacking a secret

- Let's find out what is in these Helm secrets

.lab[

- Examine the secret corresponding to the second release of `orange`:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe secret sh.helm.release.v1.orange.v2
  ```
  (`v1` is the secret format; `v2` means revision 2 of the `orange` release)

]

There is a key named `release`.

.debug[[k8s/helm-secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-secrets.md)]
---

## Unpacking the release data

- Let's see what's in this `release` thing!

.lab[

- Dump the secret:
  ```bash
  kubectl get secret sh.helm.release.v1.orange.v2 \
      -o go-template='{{ .data.release }}'
  ```

]

Secrets are encoded in base64. We need to decode that!

.debug[[k8s/helm-secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-secrets.md)]
---

## Decoding base64

- We can pipe the output through `base64 -d` or use go-template's `base64decode`

.lab[

- Decode the secret:
  ```bash
  kubectl get secret sh.helm.release.v1.orange.v2 \
      -o go-template='{{ .data.release | base64decode }}'
  ```

]

--

... Wait, this *still* looks like base64. What's going on?

--

Let's try one more round of decoding!

.debug[[k8s/helm-secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-secrets.md)]
---

## Decoding harder

- Just add one more base64 decode filter

.lab[

- Decode it twice:
  ```bash
  kubectl get secret sh.helm.release.v1.orange.v2 \
      -o go-template='{{ .data.release | base64decode | base64decode }}'
  ```

]

--

... OK, that was *a lot* of binary data. What sould we do with it?

.debug[[k8s/helm-secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-secrets.md)]
---

## Guessing data type

- We could use `file` to figure out the data type

.lab[

- Pipe the decoded release through `file -`:
  ```bash
  kubectl get secret sh.helm.release.v1.orange.v2 \
      -o go-template='{{ .data.release | base64decode | base64decode }}' \
      | file -
  ```

]

--

Gzipped data! It can be decoded with `gunzip -c`.

.debug[[k8s/helm-secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-secrets.md)]
---

## Uncompressing the data

- Let's uncompress the data and save it to a file

.lab[

- Rerun the previous command, but with `| gunzip -c > release-info` :
  ```bash
  kubectl get secret sh.helm.release.v1.orange.v2 \
      -o go-template='{{ .data.release | base64decode | base64decode }}' \
      | gunzip -c > release-info
  ```

- Look at `release-info`:
  ```bash
  cat release-info
  ```

]

--

It's a bundle of ~~YAML~~ JSON.

.debug[[k8s/helm-secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-secrets.md)]
---

## Looking at the JSON

If we inspect that JSON (e.g. with `jq keys release-info`), we see:

- `chart` (contains the entire chart used for that release)
- `config` (contains the values that we've set)
- `info` (date of deployment, status messages)
- `manifest` (YAML generated from the templates)
- `name` (name of the release, so `orange`)
- `namespace` (namespace where we deployed the release)
- `version` (revision number within that release; starts at 1)

The chart is in a structured format, but it's entirely captured in this JSON.

.debug[[k8s/helm-secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/helm-secrets.md)]
---

## Conclusions

- Helm stores each release information in a Secret in the namespace of the release

- The secret is JSON object (gzipped and encoded in base64)

- It contains the manifests generated for that release

- ... And everything needed to rebuild these manifests

  (including the full source of the chart, and the values used)

- This allows arbitrary rollbacks, as well as tweaking values even without having access to the source of the chart (or the chart repo) used for deployment

# CI/CD with GitLab

- In this section, we will see how to set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitLab

  (using a "self-hosted" GitLab; i.e. running on our Kubernetes cluster)

- The big picture:

  - each time we push code to GitLab, it will be deployed in a staging environment

  - each time we push the `production` tag, it will be deployed in production

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Disclaimers

- We'll use GitLab here as an example, but there are many other options

  (e.g. some combination of Argo, Harbor, Tekton ...)

- There are also hosted options

  (e.g. GitHub Actions and many others)

- We'll use a specific pipeline and workflow, but it's purely arbitrary

  (treat it as a source of inspiration, not a model to be copied!)

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Workflow overview

- Push code to GitLab's git server

- GitLab notices the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, which defines our pipeline

- Our pipeline can have multiple *stages* executed sequentially

  (e.g. lint, build, test, deploy ...)

- Each stage can have multiple *jobs* executed in parallel

  (e.g. build images in parallel)

- Each job will be executed in an independent *runner* pod

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Pipeline overview

- Our repository holds source code, Dockerfiles, and a Helm chart

- *Lint* stage will check the Helm chart validity

- *Build* stage will build container images

  (and push them to GitLab's integrated registry)

- *Deploy* stage will deploy the Helm chart, using these images

- Pushes to `production` will deploy to "the" production namespace

- Pushes to other tags/branches will deploy to a namespace created on the fly

- We will discuss shortcomings and alternatives and the end of this chapter!

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Lots of requirements

- We need *a lot* of components to pull this off:

  - a domain name

  - a storage class

  - a TLS-capable ingress controller

  - the cert-manager operator

  - GitLab itself

  - the GitLab pipeline

- Wow, why?!?

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## I find your lack of TLS disturbing

- We need a container registry (obviously!)

- Docker (and other container engines) *require* TLS on the registry

  (with valid certificates)

- A few options:

  - use a "real" TLS certificate (e.g. obtained with Let's Encrypt)

  - use a self-signed TLS certificate

  - communicate with the registry over localhost (TLS isn't required then)

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Why not self-signed certs?

- When using self-signed certs, we need to either:

  - add the cert (or CA) to trusted certs

  - disable cert validation

- This needs to be done on *every client* connecting to the registry:

  - CI/CD pipeline (building and pushing images)

  - container engine (deploying the images)

  - other tools (e.g. container security scanner)

- It's doable, but it's a lot of hacks (especially when adding more tools!)

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Why not localhost?

- TLS is usually not required when the registry is on localhost

- We could expose the registry e.g. on a `NodePort`

- ... And then tweak the CI/CD pipeline to use that instead

- This is great when obtaining valid certs is difficult:

  - air-gapped or internal environments (that can't use Let's Encrypt)

  - no domain name available

- Downside: the registry isn't easily or safely available from outside

  (the `NodePort` essentially defeats TLS)

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Can we use `nip.io`?

- We will use Let's Encrypt

- Let's Encrypt has a quota of certificates per domain

  (in 2020, that was [50 certificates per week per domain](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/))

- So if we all use `nip.io`, we will probably run into that limit

- But you can try and see if it works!

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Ingress

- We will assume that we have a domain name pointing to our cluster

  (i.e. with a wildcard record pointing to at least one node of the cluster)

- We will get traffic in the cluster by leveraging `ExternalIPs` services

  (but it would be easy to use `LoadBalancer` services instead)

- We will use Traefik as the ingress controller

  (but any other one should work too)

- We will use cert-manager to obtain certificates with Let's Encrypt

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Other details

- We will deploy GitLab with its official Helm chart

- It will still require a bunch of parameters and customization

- We also need a Storage Class

  (unless our cluster already has one, of course)

- We suggest the [Rancher local path provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner)

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Setting everything up

1. `git clone https://github.com/jpetazzo/kubecoin`

2. `export EMAIL=xxx@example.com DOMAIN=awesome-kube-ci.io`

   (we need a real email address and a domain pointing to the cluster!)

3. `. setup-gitlab-on-k8s.rc`

   (this doesn't do anything, but defines a number of helper functions)

4. Execute each helper function, one after another

   (try `do_[TAB]` to see these functions)

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Local Storage

`do_1_localstorage`

Applies the YAML directly from Rancher's repository.

Annotate the Storage Class so that it becomes the default one.

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Traefik

`do_2_traefik_with_externalips`

Install the official Traefik Helm chart.

Instead of a `LoadBalancer` service, use a `ClusterIP` with `ExternalIPs`.

Automatically infer the `ExternalIPs` from `kubectl get nodes`.

Enable TLS.

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## cert-manager

`do_3_certmanager`

Install cert-manager using their official YAML.

Easy-peasy.

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Certificate issuers

`do_4_issuers`

Create a couple of `ClusterIssuer` resources for cert-manager.

(One for the staging Let's Encrypt environment, one for production.)

Note: this requires to specify a valid `$EMAIL` address!

Note: if this fails, wait a bit and try again (cert-manager needs to be up).

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## GitLab

`do_5_gitlab`

Deploy GitLab using their official Helm chart.

We pass a lot of parameters to this chart:
- the domain name to use
- disable GitLab's own ingress and cert-manager
- annotate the ingress resources so that cert-manager kicks in
- bind the shell service (git over SSH) to port 222 to avoid conflict
- use ExternalIPs for that shell service

Note: on modest cloud instances, it can take 10 minutes for GitLab to come up.

We can check the status with `kubectl get pods --namespace=gitlab`

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Log into GitLab and configure it

`do_6_showlogin`

This will get the GitLab root password (stored in a Secret).

Then we need to:
- log into GitLab
- add our SSH key (top-right user menu ‚Üí settings, then SSH keys on the left)
- create a project (using the + menu next to the search bar on top)
- go to project configuration (on the left, settings ‚Üí CI/CD)
- add a `KUBECONFIG` file variable with the content of our `.kube/config` file
- go to settings ‚Üí access tokens to create a read-only registry token
- add variables `REGISTRY_USER` and `REGISTRY_PASSWORD` with that token
- push our repo (`git remote add gitlab ...` then `git push gitlab ...`)

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Monitoring progress and troubleshooting

- Click on "CI/CD" in the left bar to view pipelines

- If you see a permission issue mentioning `system:serviceaccount:gitlab:...`:

  *make sure you did set `KUBECONFIG` correctly!*

- GitLab will create namespaces named `gl-<user>-<project>`

- At the end of the deployment, the web UI will be available on some unique URL

  (`http://<user>-<project>-<githash>-gitlab.<domain>`)

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Production

- `git tag -f production && git push -f --tags`

- Our CI/CD pipeline will deploy on the production URL

  (`http://<user>-<project>-gitlab.<domain>`)

- It will do it *only* if that same git commit was pushed to staging first

  (look in the pipeline configuration file to see how it's done!)

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Let's talk about build

- There are many ways to build container images on Kubernetes

- ~~And they all suck~~ Many of them have inconveniencing issues

- Let's do a quick review!

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Docker-based approaches

- Bind-mount the Docker socket

  - very easy, but requires Docker Engine
  - build resource usage "evades" Kubernetes scheduler
  - insecure

- Docker-in-Docker in a pod

  - requires privileged pod
  - insecure
  - approaches like rootless or sysbox might help in the future

- External build host

  - more secure
  - requires resources outside of the Kubernetes cluster

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Non-privileged builders

- Kaniko

  - each build runs in its own containers or pod
  - no caching by default
  - registry-based caching is possible

- BuildKit / `docker buildx`

  - can leverage Docker Engine or long-running Kubernetes worker pod
  - supports distributed, multi-arch build farms
  - basic caching out of the box
  - can also leverage registry-based caching

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Other approaches

- Ditch the Dockerfile!

- bazel

- jib

- ko

- etc.

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Discussion

- Our CI/CD workflow is just *one* of the many possibilities

- It would be nice to add some actual unit or e2e tests

- Map the production namespace to a "real" domain name

- Automatically remove older staging environments

  (see e.g. [kube-janitor](https://codeberg.org/hjacobs/kube-janitor))

- Deploy production to a separate cluster

- Better segregate permissions

  (don't give `cluster-admin` to the GitLab pipeline)

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Pros

- GitLab is an amazing, open source, all-in-one platform

- Available as hosted, community, or enterprise editions

- Rich ecosystem, very customizable

- Can run on Kubernetes, or somewhere else

.debug[[k8s/gitlab.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/gitlab.md)]
---

## Cons

- It can be difficult to use components separately

  (e.g. use a different registry, or a different job runner)

- More than one way to configure it

  (it's not an opinionated platform)

- Not "Kubernetes-native"

  (for instance, jobs are not Kubernetes jobs)

- Job latency could be improved

*Note: most of these drawbacks are the flip side of the "pros" on the previous slide!*

# Network policies

- Namespaces help us to *organize* resources

- Namespaces do not provide isolation

- By default, every pod can contact every other pod

- By default, every service accepts traffic from anyone

- If we want this to be different, we need *network policies*

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## What's a network policy?

A network policy is defined by the following things.

- A *pod selector* indicating which pods it applies to

  e.g.: "all pods in namespace `blue` with the label `zone=internal`"

- A list of *ingress rules* indicating which inbound traffic is allowed

  e.g.: "TCP connections to ports 8000 and 8080 coming from pods with label `zone=dmz`,
  and from the external subnet 4.42.6.0/24, except 4.42.6.5"

- A list of *egress rules* indicating which outbound traffic is allowed

A network policy can provide ingress rules, egress rules, or both.

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## How do network policies apply?

- A pod can be "selected" by any number of network policies

- If a pod isn't selected by any network policy, then its traffic is unrestricted

  (In other words: in the absence of network policies, all traffic is allowed)

- If a pod is selected by at least one network policy, then all traffic is blocked ...

  ... unless it is explicitly allowed by one of these network policies

class: extra-details

## Traffic filtering is flow-oriented

- Network policies deal with *connections*, not individual packets

- Example: to allow HTTP (80/tcp) connections to pod A, you only need an ingress rule

  (You do not need a matching egress rule to allow response traffic to go through)

- This also applies for UDP traffic

  (Allowing DNS traffic can be done with a single rule)

- Network policy implementations use stateful connection tracking

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Pod-to-pod traffic

- Connections from pod A to pod B have to be allowed by both pods:

  - pod A has to be unrestricted, or allow the connection as an *egress* rule

  - pod B has to be unrestricted, or allow the connection as an *ingress* rule

- As a consequence: if a network policy restricts traffic going from/to a pod,
  <br/>
  the restriction cannot be overridden by a network policy selecting another pod

- This prevents an entity managing network policies in namespace A
  (but without permission to do so in namespace B)
  from adding network policies giving them access to namespace B

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## The rationale for network policies

- In network security, it is generally considered better to "deny all, then allow selectively"

  (The other approach, "allow all, then block selectively" makes it too easy to leave holes)

- As soon as one network policy selects a pod, the pod enters this "deny all" logic

- Further network policies can open additional access

- Good network policies should be scoped as precisely as possible

- In particular: make sure that the selector is not too broad

  (Otherwise, you end up affecting pods that were otherwise well secured)

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Our first network policy

This is our game plan:

- run a web server in a pod

- create a network policy to block all access to the web server

- create another network policy to allow access only from specific pods

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Running our test web server

.lab[

- Let's use the `nginx` image:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment testweb --image=nginx
  ```

<!--
```bash
kubectl wait deployment testweb --for condition=available
```
-->

- Find out the IP address of the pod with one of these two commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide -l app=testweb
  IP=$(kubectl get pods -l app=testweb -o json | jq -r .items[0].status.podIP)
  ```

- Check that we can connect to the server:
  ```bash
  curl $IP
  ```
]

The `curl` command should show us the "Welcome to nginx!" page.

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Adding a very restrictive network policy

- The policy will select pods with the label `app=testweb`

- It will specify an empty list of ingress rules (matching nothing)

.lab[

- Apply the policy in this YAML file:
  ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/netpol-deny-all-for-testweb.yaml
  ```

- Check if we can still access the server:
  ```bash
  curl $IP
  ```

<!--
```wait curl```
```key ^C```
-->

]

The `curl` command should now time out.

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Looking at the network policy

This is the file that we applied:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-all-for-testweb
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: testweb
  ingress: []


```

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Allowing connections only from specific pods

- We want to allow traffic from pods with the label `run=testcurl`

- Reminder: this label is automatically applied when we do `kubectl run testcurl ...`

.lab[

- Apply another policy:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/netpol-allow-testcurl-for-testweb.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Looking at the network policy

This is the second file that we applied:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-testcurl-for-testweb
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: testweb
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          run: testcurl


```

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Testing the network policy

- Let's create pods with, and without, the required label

.lab[

- Try to connect to testweb from a pod with the `run=testcurl` label:
  ```bash
  kubectl run testcurl --rm -i --image=centos -- curl -m3 $IP
  ```

- Try to connect to testweb with a different label:
  ```bash
  kubectl run testkurl --rm -i --image=centos -- curl -m3 $IP
  ```

]

The first command will work (and show the "Welcome to nginx!" page).

The second command will fail and time out after 3 seconds.

(The timeout is obtained with the `-m3` option.)

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## An important warning

- Some network plugins only have partial support for network policies

- For instance, Weave added support for egress rules [in version 2.4](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/pull/3313) (released in July 2018)

- But only recently added support for ipBlock [in version 2.5](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/pull/3367) (released in Nov 2018)

- Unsupported features might be silently ignored

  (Making you believe that you are secure, when you're not)

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Network policies, pods, and services

- Network policies apply to *pods*

- A *service* can select multiple pods

  (And load balance traffic across them)

- It is possible that we can connect to some pods, but not some others

  (Because of how network policies have been defined for these pods)

- In that case, connections to the service will randomly pass or fail

  (Depending on whether the connection was sent to a pod that we have access to or not)

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Network policies and namespaces

- A good strategy is to isolate a namespace, so that:

  - all the pods in the namespace can communicate together

  - other namespaces cannot access the pods

  - external access has to be enabled explicitly

- Let's see what this would look like for the DockerCoins app!

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Network policies for DockerCoins

- We are going to apply two policies

- The first policy will prevent traffic from other namespaces

- The second policy will allow traffic to the `webui` pods

- That's all we need for that app!

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Blocking traffic from other namespaces

This policy selects all pods in the current namespace.

It allows traffic only from pods in the current namespace.

(An empty `podSelector` means "all pods.")

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-from-other-namespaces
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}
```

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Allowing traffic to `webui` pods

This policy selects all pods with label `app=webui`.

It allows traffic from any source.

(An empty `from` field means "all sources.")

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-webui
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: webui
  ingress:
  - from: []
```

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Applying both network policies

- Both network policies are declared in the file [k8s/netpol-dockercoins.yaml](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/tree/master/k8s/netpol-dockercoins.yaml)

.lab[

- Apply the network policies:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/netpol-dockercoins.yaml
  ```

- Check that we can still access the web UI from outside
  <br/>
  (and that the app is still working correctly!)

- Check that we can't connect anymore to `rng` or `hasher` through their ClusterIP

]

Note: using `kubectl proxy` or `kubectl port-forward` allows us to connect
regardless of existing network policies. This allows us to debug and
troubleshoot easily, without having to poke holes in our firewall.

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Cleaning up our network policies

- The network policies that we have installed block all traffic to the default namespace

- We should remove them, otherwise further demos and exercises will fail!

.lab[

- Remove all network policies:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete networkpolicies --all
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Protecting the control plane

- Should we add network policies to block unauthorized access to the control plane?

  (etcd, API server, etc.)

--

- At first, it seems like a good idea ...

--

- But it *shouldn't* be necessary:

  - not all network plugins support network policies

  - the control plane is secured by other methods (mutual TLS, mostly)

  - the code running in our pods can reasonably expect to contact the API
    <br/>
    (and it can do so safely thanks to the API permission model)

- If we block access to the control plane, we might disrupt legitimate code

- ...Without necessarily improving security

# Authentication and authorization

- In this section, we will:

  - define authentication and authorization

  - explain how they are implemented in Kubernetes

  - talk about tokens, certificates, service accounts, RBAC ...

- But first: why do we need all this?

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## The need for fine-grained security

- The Kubernetes API should only be available for identified users

  - we don't want "guest access" (except in very rare scenarios)

  - we don't want strangers to use our compute resources, delete our apps ...

  - our keys and passwords should not be exposed to the public

- Users will often have different access rights

  - cluster admin (similar to UNIX "root") can do everything

  - developer might access specific resources, or a specific namespace

  - supervision might have read only access to *most* resources

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Example: custom HTTP load balancer

- Let's imagine that we have a custom HTTP load balancer for multiple apps

- Each app has its own *Deployment* resource

- By default, the apps are "sleeping" and scaled to zero

- When a request comes in, the corresponding app gets woken up

- After some inactivity, the app is scaled down again

- This HTTP load balancer needs API access (to scale up/down)

- What if *a wild vulnerability appears*?

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Consequences of vulnerability

- If the HTTP load balancer has the same API access as we do:

  *full cluster compromise (easy data leak, cryptojacking...)*

- If the HTTP load balancer has `update` permissions on the Deployments:

  *defacement (easy), MITM / impersonation (medium to hard)*

- If the HTTP load balancer only has permission to `scale` the Deployments:

  *denial-of-service*

- All these outcomes are bad, but some are worse than others

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Definitions

- Authentication = verifying the identity of a person

  On a UNIX system, we can authenticate with login+password, SSH keys ...

- Authorization = listing what they are allowed to do

  On a UNIX system, this can include file permissions, sudoer entries ...

- Sometimes abbreviated as "authn" and "authz"

- In good modular systems, these things are decoupled

   (so we can e.g. change a password or SSH key without having to reset access rights)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Authentication in Kubernetes

- When the API server receives a request, it tries to authenticate it

  (it examines headers, certificates... anything available)

- Many authentication methods are available and can be used simultaneously

  (we will see them on the next slide)

- It's the job of the authentication method to produce:

  - the user name
  - the user ID
  - a list of groups

- The API server doesn't interpret these; that'll be the job of *authorizers*

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Authentication methods

- TLS client certificates

  (that's the default for clusters provisioned with `kubeadm`)

- Bearer tokens

  (a secret token in the HTTP headers of the request)

- [HTTP basic auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)

  (carrying user and password in an HTTP header; [deprecated since Kubernetes 1.19](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89069))

- Authentication proxy

  (sitting in front of the API and setting trusted headers)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Anonymous requests

- If any authentication method *rejects* a request, it's denied

  (`401 Unauthorized` HTTP code)

- If a request is neither rejected nor accepted by anyone, it's anonymous

  - the user name is `system:anonymous`

  - the list of groups is `[system:unauthenticated]`

- By default, the anonymous user can't do anything

  (that's what you get if you just `curl` the Kubernetes API)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Authentication with TLS certificates

- Enabled in almost all Kubernetes deployments

- The user name is indicated by the `CN` in the client certificate

- The groups are indicated by the `O` fields in the client certificate

- From the point of view of the Kubernetes API, users do not exist

  (i.e. there is no resource with `kind: User`)

- The Kubernetes API can be set up to use your custom CA to validate client certs

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Authentication for kubelet

- In most clusters, kubelets authenticate using certificates

  (`O=system:nodes`, `CN=system:node:name-of-the-node`)

- The Kubernetse API can act as a CA

  (by wrapping an X509 CSR into a CertificateSigningRequest resource)

- This enables kubelets to renew their own certificates

- It can also be used to issue user certificates

  (but it lacks flexibility; e.g. validity can't be customized)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## User certificates in practice

- The Kubernetes API server does not support certificate revocation

  (see issue [#18982](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/18982))

- As a result, we don't have an easy way to terminate someone's access

  (if their key is compromised, or they leave the organization)

- Issue short-lived certificates if you use them to authenticate users!

  (short-lived = a few hours)

- This can be facilitated by e.g. Vault, cert-manager...

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## What if a certificate is compromised?

- Option 1: wait for the certificate to expire

  (which is why short-lived certs are convenient!)

- Option 2: remove access from that certificate's user and groups

  - if that user was `bob.smith`, create a new user `bob.smith.2`

  - if Bob was in groups `dev`, create a new group `dev.2`

  - let's agree that this is not a great solution!

- Option 3: re-create a new CA and re-issue all certificates

  - let's agree that this is an even worse solution!

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Authentication with tokens

- Tokens are passed as HTTP headers:

  `Authorization: Bearer and-then-here-comes-the-token`

- Tokens can be validated through a number of different methods:

  - static tokens hard-coded in a file on the API server

  - [bootstrap tokens](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/bootstrap-tokens/) (special case to create a cluster or join nodes)

  - [OpenID Connect tokens](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens) (to delegate authentication to compatible OAuth2 providers)

  - service accounts (these deserve more details, coming right up!)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Service accounts

- A service account is a user that exists in the Kubernetes API

  (it is visible with e.g. `kubectl get serviceaccounts`)

- Service accounts can therefore be created / updated dynamically

  (they don't require hand-editing a file and restarting the API server)

- A service account is associated with a set of secrets

  (the kind that you can view with `kubectl get secrets`)

- Service accounts are generally used to grant permissions to applications, services...

  (as opposed to humans)

class: extra-details

## Checking our authentication method

- Let's check our kubeconfig file

- Do we have a certificate, a token, or something else?

## Inspecting a certificate

If we have a certificate, let's use the following command:

```bash
kubectl config view \
        --raw \
        -o json \
        | jq -r .users[0].user[\"client-certificate-data\"] \
        | openssl base64 -d -A \
        | openssl x509 -text \
        | grep Subject:
```

This command will show the `CN` and `O` fields for our certificate.

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Breaking down the command

- `kubectl config view` shows the Kubernetes user configuration
- `--raw` includes certificate information (which shows as REDACTED otherwise)
- `-o json` outputs the information in JSON format
- `| jq ...` extracts the field with the user certificate (in base64)
- `| openssl base64 -d -A` decodes the base64 format (now we have a PEM file)
- `| openssl x509 -text` parses the certificate and outputs it as plain text
- `| grep Subject:` shows us the line that interests us

‚Üí We are user `kubernetes-admin`, in group `system:masters`.

(We will see later how and why this gives us the permissions that we have.)

## Inspecting a token

If we have a token, let's use the following command:

```bash
kubectl config view \
        --raw \
        -o json \
        | jq -r .users[0].user.token \
        | base64 -d \
        | cut -d. -f2 \
        | base64 -d \
        | jq .
```

If our token is a JWT / OIDC token, this command will show its content.

---

class: extra-details

## Other authentication methods

- Other types of tokens

  - these tokens are typically shorter than JWT or OIDC tokens

  - it is generally not possible to extract information from them

- Plugins

  - some clusters use external `exec` plugins

  - these plugins typically use API keys to generate or obtain tokens

  - example: the AWS EKS authenticator works this way

## Token authentication in practice

- We are going to list existing service accounts

- Then we will extract the token for a given service account

- And we will use that token to authenticate with the API

## Listing service accounts

.lab[

- The resource name is `serviceaccount` or `sa` for short:

.lab[

- List the secrets for the `default` service account:
  ```bash
  kubectl get sa default -o yaml
  SECRET=$(kubectl get sa default -o json | jq -r .secrets[0].name)
  ```

]

It should be named `default-token-XXXXX`.

## Using the token

- Let's send a request to the API, without and with the token

.lab[

- Find the ClusterIP for the `kubernetes` service:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc kubernetes
  API=$(kubectl get svc kubernetes -o json | jq -r .spec.clusterIP)

## Results

- In both cases, we will get a "Forbidden" error

- Without authentication, the user is `system:anonymous`

- With authentication, it is shown as `system:serviceaccount:default:default`

- The API "sees" us as a different user

- But neither user has any rights, so we can't do nothin'

- Let's change that!

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]

## Authorization in Kubernetes

- There are multiple ways to grant permissions in Kubernetes, called [authorizers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/#authorization-modules):

  - [Node Authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/node/) (used internally by kubelet; we can ignore it)

  - [Attribute-based access control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/abac/) (powerful but complex and static; ignore it too)

  - [Webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/webhook/) (each API request is submitted to an external service for approval)

  - [Role-based access control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) (associates permissions to users dynamically)

- The one we want is the last one, generally abbreviated as RBAC

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Role-based access control

- RBAC allows to specify fine-grained permissions

- Permissions are expressed as *rules*

- A rule is a combination of:

  - [verbs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/#determine-the-request-verb) like create, get, list, update, delete...

  - resources (as in "API resource," like pods, nodes, services...)

  - resource names (to specify e.g. one specific pod instead of all pods)

  - in some case, [subresources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#referring-to-resources) (e.g. logs are subresources of pods)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Listing all possible verbs

- The Kubernetes API is self-documented

- We can ask it which resources, subresources, and verb exist

- One way to do this is to use:

  - `kubectl get --raw /api/v1` (for core resources with `apiVersion: v1`)

  - `kubectl get --raw /apis/<group>/<version>` (for other resources)

- The JSON response can be formatted with e.g. `jq` for readability

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Examples

- List all verbs across all `v1` resources

  ```bash
  kubectl get --raw /api/v1 | jq -r .resources[].verbs[] | sort -u
  ```

- List all resources and subresources in `apps/v1`

  ```bash
  kubectl get --raw /apis/apps/v1 | jq -r .resources[].name
  ```

- List which verbs are available on which resources in `networking.k8s.io`

  ```bash
  kubectl get --raw /apis/networking.k8s.io/v1 | \
          jq -r '.resources[] | .name + ": " + (.verbs | join(", "))'
  ```

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## From rules to roles to rolebindings

- A *role* is an API object containing a list of *rules*

  Example: role "external-load-balancer-configurator" can:
  - [list, get] resources [endpoints, services, pods]
  - [update] resources [services]

- A *rolebinding* associates a role with a user

  Example: rolebinding "external-load-balancer-configurator":
  - associates user "external-load-balancer-configurator"
  - with role "external-load-balancer-configurator"

- Yes, there can be users, roles, and rolebindings with the same name

- It's a good idea for 1-1-1 bindings; not so much for 1-N ones

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Cluster-scope permissions

- API resources Role and RoleBinding are for objects within a namespace

- We can also define API resources ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding

- These are a superset, allowing us to:

  - specify actions on cluster-wide objects (like nodes)

  - operate across all namespaces

- We can create Role and RoleBinding resources within a namespace

- ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding resources are global

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Pods and service accounts

- A pod can be associated with a service account

  - by default, it is associated with the `default` service account

  - as we saw earlier, this service account has no permissions anyway

- The associated token is exposed to the pod's filesystem

  (in `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`)

- Standard Kubernetes tooling (like `kubectl`) will look for it there

- So Kubernetes tools running in a pod will automatically use the service account

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## In practice

- We are going to run a pod

- This pod will use the default service account of its namespace

- We will check our API permissions

  (there shouldn't be any)

- Then we will bind a role to the service account

- We will check that we were granted the corresponding permissions

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Running a pod

- We'll use [Nixery](https://nixery.dev/) to run a pod with `curl` and `kubectl`

- Nixery automatically generates images with the requested packages

.lab[

- Run our pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl run eyepod --rm -ti --restart=Never \
          --image nixery.dev/shell/curl/kubectl -- bash
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Checking our permissions

- Normally, at this point, we don't have any API permission

.lab[

- Check our permissions with `kubectl`:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

- We should get a message telling us that our service account
  doesn't have permissions to list "pods" in the current namespace

- We can also make requests to the API server directly

  (use `kubectl -v6` to see the exact request URI!)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Binding a role to the service account

- Binding a role = creating a *rolebinding* object

- We will call that object `can-view`

  (but again, we could call it `view` or whatever we like)

.lab[

- Create the new role binding:
  ```bash
  kubectl create rolebinding can-view \
          --clusterrole=view \
          --serviceaccount=default:default
  ```

]

It's important to note a couple of details in these flags...

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Roles vs Cluster Roles

- We used `--clusterrole=view`

- What would have happened if we had used `--role=view`?

  - we would have bound the role `view` from the local namespace
    <br/>(instead of the cluster role `view`)

  - the command would have worked fine (no error)

  - but later, our API requests would have been denied

- This is a deliberate design decision

  (we can reference roles that don't exist, and create/update them later)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Users vs Service Accounts

- We used `--serviceaccount=default:default`

- What would have happened if we had used `--user=default:default`?

  - we would have bound the role to a user instead of a service account

  - again, the command would have worked fine (no error)

  - ...but our API requests would have been denied later

- What's about the `default:` prefix?

  - that's the namespace of the service account

  - yes, it could be inferred from context, but... `kubectl` requires it

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Checking our new permissions

- We should be able to *view* things, but not to *edit* them

.lab[

- Check our permissions with `kubectl`:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

- Try to create something:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment can-i-do-this --image=nginx
  ```

- Exit the container with `exit` or `^D`

<!-- ```key ^D``` -->

]

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## `kubectl run --serviceaccount`

- `kubectl run` also has a `--serviceaccount` flag

- ...But it's supposed to be deprecated "soon"

  (see [kubernetes/kubernetes#99732](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99732) for details)

- It's possible to specify the service account with an override:
  ```bash
  kubectl run my-pod -ti --image=alpine --restart=Never \
          --overrides='{ "spec": { "serviceAccountName" : "my-service-account" } }'
  ```

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## `kubectl auth` and other CLI tools

- The `kubectl auth can-i` command can tell us:

  - if we can perform an action

  - if someone else can perform an action

  - what actions we can perform

- There are also other very useful tools to work with RBAC

- Let's do a quick review!

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## `kubectl auth can-i dothis onthat`

- These commands will give us a `yes`/`no` answer:

  ```bash
  kubectl auth can-i list nodes
  kubectl auth can-i create pods
  kubectl auth can-i get pod/name-of-pod
  kubectl auth can-i get /url-fragment-of-api-request/
  kubectl auth can-i '*' services
  kubectl auth can-i get coffee
  kubectl auth can-i drink coffee
  ```

- The RBAC system is flexible

- We can check permissions on resources that don't exist yet (e.g. CRDs)

- We can check permissions for arbitrary actions

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## `kubectl auth can-i ... --as someoneelse`

- We can check permissions on behalf of other users

  ```bash
  kubectl auth can-i list nodes \
          --as some-user
  kubectl auth can-i list nodes \
          --as system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<name-of-service-account>
  ```

- We can also use `--as-group` to check permissions for members of a group

- `--as` and `--as-group` leverage the *impersonation API*

- These flags can be used with many other `kubectl` commands

  (not just `auth can-i`)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## `kubectl auth can-i --list`

- We can list the actions that are available to us:

  ```bash
  kubectl auth can-i --list
  ```

- ... Or to someone else (with `--as SomeOtherUser`)

- This is very useful to check users or service accounts for overly broad permissions

  (or when looking for ways to exploit a security vulnerability!)

class: extra-details

## Other useful tools

- For auditing purposes, sometimes we want to know who can perform which actions

- There are a few tools to help us with that, available as `kubectl` plugins:

  - `kubectl who-can` / [kubectl-who-can](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kubectl-who-can) by Aqua Security

  - `kubectl access-matrix` / [Rakkess (Review Access)](https://github.com/corneliusweig/rakkess) by Cornelius Weig

  - `kubectl rbac-lookup` / [RBAC Lookup](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/rbac-lookup) by FairwindsOps

  - `kubectl rbac-tool` / [RBAC Tool](https://github.com/alcideio/rbac-tool) by insightCloudSec

- `kubectl` plugins can be installed and managed with `krew`

- They can also be installed and executed as standalone programs

## Where does this `view` role come from?

- Kubernetes defines a number of ClusterRoles intended to be bound to users

- `cluster-admin` can do *everything* (think `root` on UNIX)

- `admin` can do *almost everything* (except e.g. changing resource quotas and limits)

- `edit` is similar to `admin`, but cannot view or edit permissions

- `view` has read-only access to most resources, except permissions and secrets

*In many situations, these roles will be all you need.*

*You can also customize them!*

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Customizing the default roles

- If you need to *add* permissions to these default roles (or others),
  <br/>
  you can do it through the [ClusterRole Aggregation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#aggregated-clusterroles) mechanism

- This happens by creating a ClusterRole with the following labels:
  ```yaml
    metadata:
      labels:
        rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-admin: "true"
        rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-edit: "true"
        rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-view: "true"
  ```

- This ClusterRole permissions will be added to `admin`/`edit`/`view` respectively

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## When should we use aggregation?

- By default, CRDs aren't included in `view` / `edit` / etc.

  (Kubernetes cannot guess which one are security sensitive and which ones are not)

- If we edit `view` / `edit` / etc directly, our edits will conflict

  (imagine if we have two CRDs and they both provide a custom `view` ClusterRole)

- Using aggregated roles lets us enrich the default roles without touching them

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## How aggregation works

- The corresponding roles will have `aggregationRules` like this:

   ```yaml
    aggregationRule:
      clusterRoleSelectors:
      - matchLabels:
          rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-view: "true"
   ```

- We can define our own custom roles with their own aggregation rules

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Where do our permissions come from?

- When interacting with the Kubernetes API, we are using a client certificate

- We saw previously that this client certificate contained:

  `CN=kubernetes-admin` and `O=system:masters`

- Let's look for these in existing ClusterRoleBindings:
  ```bash
  kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o yaml |
    grep -e kubernetes-admin -e system:masters
  ```

  (`system:masters` should show up, but not `kubernetes-admin`.)

- Where does this match come from?

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The `system:masters` group

- If we eyeball the output of `kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o yaml`, we'll find out!

- It is in the `cluster-admin` binding:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe clusterrolebinding cluster-admin
  ```

- This binding associates `system:masters` with the cluster role `cluster-admin`

- And the `cluster-admin` is, basically, `root`:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe clusterrole cluster-admin
  ```

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## `list` vs. `get`

‚ö†Ô∏è `list` grants read permissions to resources!

- It's not possible to give permission to list resources without also reading them

- This has implications for e.g. Secrets

  (if a controller needs to be able to enumerate Secrets, it will be able to read them)

# Volumes

- Volumes are special directories that are mounted in containers

- Volumes can have many different purposes:

  - share files and directories between containers running on the same machine

  - share files and directories between containers and their host

  - centralize configuration information in Kubernetes and expose it to containers

  - manage credentials and secrets and expose them securely to containers

  - store persistent data for stateful services

  - access storage systems (like Ceph, EBS, NFS, Portworx, and many others)

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Kubernetes volumes vs. Docker volumes

- Kubernetes and Docker volumes are very similar

  (the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) says otherwise ...
  <br/>
  but it refers to Docker 1.7, which was released in 2015!)

- Docker volumes allow us to share data between containers running on the same host

- Kubernetes volumes allow us to share data between containers in the same pod

- Both Docker and Kubernetes volumes enable access to storage systems

- Kubernetes volumes are also used to expose configuration and secrets

- Docker has specific concepts for configuration and secrets
  <br/>
  (but under the hood, the technical implementation is similar)

- If you're not familiar with Docker volumes, you can safely ignore this slide!

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Volumes ‚â† Persistent Volumes

- Volumes and Persistent Volumes are related, but very different!

- *Volumes*:

  - appear in Pod specifications (we'll see that in a few slides)

  - do not exist as API resources (**cannot** do `kubectl get volumes`)

- *Persistent Volumes*:

  - are API resources (**can** do `kubectl get persistentvolumes`)

  - correspond to concrete volumes (e.g. on a SAN, EBS, etc.)

  - cannot be associated with a Pod directly; but through a Persistent Volume Claim

  - won't be discussed further in this section

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Adding a volume to a Pod

- We will start with the simplest Pod manifest we can find

- We will add a volume to that Pod manifest

- We will mount that volume in a container in the Pod

- By default, this volume will be an `emptyDir`

  (an empty directory)

- It will "shadow" the directory where it's mounted

## Our basic Pod

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-without-volume
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

This is a MVP! (Minimum Viable Podüòâ)

It runs a single NGINX container.

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Trying the basic pod

.lab[

- Create the Pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f ~/container.training/k8s/nginx-1-without-volume.yaml
  ```

<!-- ```bash kubectl wait pod/nginx-without-volume --for condition=ready ``` -->

- Get its IP address:
  ```bash
  IPADDR=$(kubectl get pod nginx-without-volume -o jsonpath={.status.podIP})
  ```

- Send a request with curl:
  ```bash
  curl $IPADDR
  ```

]

(We should see the "Welcome to NGINX" page.)

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Adding a volume

- We need to add the volume in two places:

  - at the Pod level (to declare the volume)

  - at the container level (to mount the volume)

- We will declare a volume named `www`

- No type is specified, so it will default to `emptyDir`

  (as the name implies, it will be initialized as an empty directory at pod creation)

- In that pod, there is also a container named `nginx`

- That container mounts the volume `www` to path `/usr/share/nginx/html/`

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volumes.md)]

## The Pod with a volume

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-with-volume
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: www
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: www
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html/
```

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volumes.md)]

## Trying the Pod with a volume

.lab[

- Create the Pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f ~/container.training/k8s/nginx-2-with-volume.yaml
  ```

<!-- ```bash kubectl wait pod/nginx-with-volume --for condition=ready ``` -->

- Get its IP address:
  ```bash
  IPADDR=$(kubectl get pod nginx-with-volume -o jsonpath={.status.podIP})
  ```

- Send a request with curl:
  ```bash
  curl $IPADDR
  ```

]

(We should now see a "403 Forbidden" error page.)

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Populating the volume with another container

- Let's add another container to the Pod

- Let's mount the volume in *both* containers

- That container will populate the volume with static files

- NGINX will then serve these static files

- To populate the volume, we will clone the Spoon-Knife repository

  - this repository is https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife

  - it's very popular (more than 100K stars!)

## Sharing a volume between two containers

.small[

```
]

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Sharing a volume, explained

- We added another container to the pod

- That container mounts the `www` volume on a different path (`/www`)

- It uses the `alpine` image

- When started, it installs `git` and clones the `octocat/Spoon-Knife` repository

  (that repository contains a tiny HTML website)

- As a result, NGINX now serves this website

- We need to catch the Pod IP address *as soon as it's created*

- Then send a request to it *as fast as possible*

.lab[

- Watch the pods (so that we can catch the Pod IP address)
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide --watch
  ```

<!--
```wait NAME```
```tmux split-pane -v```
-->

]

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Shared volume in action

.lab[

- Create the pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f ~/container.training/k8s/nginx-3-with-git.yaml
  ```

<!--
```bash kubectl wait pod/nginx-with-git --for condition=initialized```
```bash IP=$(kubectl get pod nginx-with-git -o jsonpath={.status.podIP})```
-->

- As soon as we see its IP address, access it:
  ```bash
  curl `$IP`
  ```

<!-- ```bash /bin/sleep 5``` -->

- A few seconds later, the state of the pod will change; access it again:
  ```bash
  curl `$IP`
  ```

]

The first time, we should see "403 Forbidden".

The second time, we should see the HTML file from the Spoon-Knife repository.

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Explanations

- Both containers are started at the same time

- NGINX starts very quickly

  (it can serve requests immediately)

- But at this point, the volume is empty

  (NGINX serves "403 Forbidden")

- The other containers installs git and clones the repository

  (this takes a bit longer)

- When the other container is done, the volume holds the repository

  (NGINX serves the HTML file)

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## The devil is in the details

- The default `restartPolicy` is `Always`

- This would cause our `git` container to run again ... and again ... and again

  (with an exponential back-off delay, as explained [in the documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy))

- That's why we specified `restartPolicy: OnFailure`

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Inconsistencies

- There is a short period of time during which the website is not available

  (because the `git` container hasn't done its job yet)

- With a bigger website, we could get inconsistent results

  (where only a part of the content is ready)

- In real applications, this could cause incorrect results

- How can we avoid that?

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Init Containers

- We can define containers that should execute *before* the main ones

- They will be executed in order

  (instead of in parallel)

- They must all succeed before the main containers are started

- This is *exactly* what we need here!

- Let's see one in action

.footnote[See [Init Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/) documentation for all the details.]

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Defining Init Containers

.small[
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-with-init
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: www
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: www
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html/
  initContainers:
  - name: git
    image: alpine
    command: [ "sh", "-c", "apk add git && git clone https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife /www" ]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: www
      mountPath: /www/
```
]

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Trying the init container

.lab[

- Create the pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f ~/container.training/k8s/nginx-4-with-init.yaml
  ```

- Try to send HTTP requests as soon as the pod comes up

<!--
```key ^D```
```key ^C```
-->

]

- This time, instead of "403 Forbidden" we get a "connection refused"

- NGINX doesn't start until the git container has done its job

- We never get inconsistent results

  (a "half-ready" container)

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Other uses of init containers

- Load content

- Generate configuration (or certificates)

- Database migrations

- Waiting for other services to be up

  (to avoid flurry of connection errors in main container)

- etc.

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Volume lifecycle

- The lifecycle of a volume is linked to the pod's lifecycle

- This means that a volume is created when the pod is created

- This is mostly relevant for `emptyDir` volumes

  (other volumes, like remote storage, are not "created" but rather "attached" )

- A volume survives across container restarts

- A volume is destroyed (or, for remote storage, detached) when the pod is destroyed

# Managing configuration

- Some applications need to be configured (obviously!)

- There are many ways for our code to pick up configuration:

  - command-line arguments

  - environment variables

  - configuration files

  - configuration servers (getting configuration from a database, an API...)

  - ... and more (because programmers can be very creative!)

- How can we do these things with containers and Kubernetes?

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Passing configuration to containers

- There are many ways to pass configuration to code running in a container:

  - baking it into a custom image

  - command-line arguments

  - environment variables

  - injecting configuration files

  - exposing it over the Kubernetes API

  - configuration servers

- Let's review these different strategies!

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Baking custom images

- Put the configuration in the image

  (it can be in a configuration file, but also `ENV` or `CMD` actions)

- It's easy! It's simple!

- Unfortunately, it also has downsides:

  - multiplication of images

  - different images for dev, staging, prod ...

  - minor reconfigurations require a whole build/push/pull cycle

- Avoid doing it unless you don't have the time to figure out other options

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Command-line arguments

- Indicate what should run in the container

- Pass `command` and/or `args` in the container options in a Pod's template

- Both `command` and `args` are arrays

- Example ([source](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/main/k8s/consul-1.yaml#L70)):
  ```yaml
    args:
    - "agent"
    - "-bootstrap-expect=3"
    - "-retry-join=provider=k8s label_selector=\"app=consul\" namespace=\"$(NS)\""
    - "-client=0.0.0.0"
    - "-data-dir=/consul/data"
    - "-server"
    - "-ui"
  ```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## `args` or `command`?

- Use `command` to override the `ENTRYPOINT` defined in the image

- Use `args` to keep the `ENTRYPOINT` defined in the image

  (the parameters specified in `args` are added to the `ENTRYPOINT`)

- In doubt, use `command`

- It is also possible to use *both* `command` and `args`

  (they will be strung together, just like `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD`)

- See the [docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#notes) to see how they interact together

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Command-line arguments, pros & cons

- Works great when options are passed directly to the running program

  (otherwise, a wrapper script can work around the issue)

- Works great when there aren't too many parameters

  (to avoid a 20-lines `args` array)

- Requires documentation and/or understanding of the underlying program

  ("which parameters and flags do I need, again?")

- Well-suited for mandatory parameters (without default values)

- Not ideal when we need to pass a real configuration file anyway

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Environment variables

- Pass options through the `env` map in the container specification

- Example:
  ```yaml
      env:
      - name: ADMIN_PORT
        value: "8080"
      - name: ADMIN_AUTH
        value: Basic
      - name: ADMIN_CRED
        value: "admin:0pensesame!"
  ```

.warning[`value` must be a string! Make sure that numbers and fancy strings are quoted.]

ü§î Why this weird `{name: xxx, value: yyy}` scheme? It will be revealed soon!

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## The downward API

- In the previous example, environment variables have fixed values

- We can also use a mechanism called the *downward API*

- The downward API allows exposing pod or container information

  - either through special files (we won't show that for now)

  - or through environment variables

- The value of these environment variables is computed when the container is started

- Remember: environment variables won't (can't) change after container start

- Let's see a few concrete examples!

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Exposing the pod's namespace

```yaml
    - name: MY_POD_NAMESPACE
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: metadata.namespace
```

- Useful to generate FQDN of services

  (in some contexts, a short name is not enough)

- For instance, the two commands should be equivalent:
  ```
  curl api-backend
  curl api-backend.$MY_POD_NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local
  ```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Exposing the pod's IP address

```yaml
    - name: MY_POD_IP
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: status.podIP
```

- Useful if we need to know our IP address

  (we could also read it from `eth0`, but this is more solid)

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Exposing the container's resource limits

```yaml
    - name: MY_MEM_LIMIT
      valueFrom:
        resourceFieldRef:
          containerName: test-container
          resource: limits.memory
```

- Useful for runtimes where memory is garbage collected

- Example: the JVM

  (the memory available to the JVM should be set with the `-Xmx ` flag)

- Best practice: set a memory limit, and pass it to the runtime

- Note: recent versions of the JVM can do this automatically

  (see [JDK-8146115](https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8146115))
  and
  [this blog post](https://very-serio.us/2017/12/05/running-jvms-in-kubernetes/)
  for detailed examples)

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## More about the downward API

- [This documentation page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/) tells more about these environment variables

- And [this one](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/downward-api-volume-expose-pod-information/) explains the other way to use the downward API

  (through files that get created in the container filesystem)

- That second link also includes a list of all the fields that can be used with the downward API

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Environment variables, pros and cons

- Works great when the running program expects these variables

- Works great for optional parameters with reasonable defaults

  (since the container image can provide these defaults)

- Sort of auto-documented

  (we can see which environment variables are defined in the image, and their values)

- Can be (ab)used with longer values ...

- ... You *can* put an entire Tomcat configuration file in an environment ...

- ... But *should* you?

(Do it if you really need to, we're not judging! But we'll see better ways.)

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Injecting configuration files

- Sometimes, there is no way around it: we need to inject a full config file

- Kubernetes provides a mechanism for that purpose: `configmaps`

- A configmap is a Kubernetes resource that exists in a namespace

- Conceptually, it's a key/value map

  (values are arbitrary strings)

- We can think about them in (at least) two different ways:

  - as holding entire configuration file(s)

  - as holding individual configuration parameters

*Note: to hold sensitive information, we can use "Secrets", which
are another type of resource behaving very much like configmaps.
We'll cover them just after!*

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Configmaps storing entire files

- In this case, each key/value pair corresponds to a configuration file

- Key = name of the file

- Value = content of the file

- There can be one key/value pair, or as many as necessary

  (for complex apps with multiple configuration files)

- Examples:
  ```
  # Create a configmap with a single key, "app.conf"
  kubectl create configmap my-app-config --from-file=app.conf
  # Create a configmap with a single key, "app.conf" but another file
  kubectl create configmap my-app-config --from-file=app.conf=app-prod.conf
  # Create a configmap with multiple keys (one per file in the config.d directory)
  kubectl create configmap my-app-config --from-file=config.d/
  ```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Configmaps storing individual parameters

- In this case, each key/value pair corresponds to a parameter

- Key = name of the parameter

- Value = value of the parameter

- Examples:
  ```
  # Create a configmap with two keys
  kubectl create cm my-app-config \
      --from-literal=foreground=red \
      --from-literal=background=blue
  
  # Create a configmap from a file containing key=val pairs
  kubectl create cm my-app-config \
      --from-env-file=app.conf
  ```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Exposing configmaps to containers

- Configmaps can be exposed as plain files in the filesystem of a container

  - this is achieved by declaring a volume and mounting it in the container

  - this is particularly effective for configmaps containing whole files

- Configmaps can be exposed as environment variables in the container

  - this is achieved with the downward API

  - this is particularly effective for configmaps containing individual parameters

- Let's see how to do both!

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Example: HAProxy configuration

- We are going to deploy HAProxy, a popular load balancer

- It expects to find its configuration in a specific place:

  `/usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`

- We will create a ConfigMap holding the configuration file

- Then we will mount that ConfigMap in a Pod running HAProxy

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Blue/green load balancing

- In this example, we will deploy two versions of our app:

  - the "blue" version in the `blue` namespace

  - the "green" version in the `green` namespace

- In both namespaces, we will have a Deployment and a Service

  (both named `color`)

- We want to load balance traffic between both namespaces

  (we can't do that with a simple service selector: these don't cross namespaces)

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Deploying the app

- We're going to use the image `jpetazzo/color`

  (it is a simple "HTTP echo" server showing which pod served the request)

- We can create each Namespace, Deployment, and Service by hand, or...

.lab[

- We can deploy the app with a YAML manifest:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/rainbow.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Testing the app

- Reminder: Service `x` in Namespace `y` is available through:

  `x.y`, `x.y.svc`, `x.y.svc.cluster.local`

- Since the `cluster.local` suffix can change, we'll use `x.y.svc`

.lab[

- Check that the app is up and running:
  ```bash
    kubectl run --rm -it --restart=Never --image=nixery.dev/curl my-test-pod \
            curl color.blue.svc
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Creating the HAProxy configuration

Here is the file that we will use, [k8s/haproxy.cfg](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/tree/master/k8s/haproxy.cfg):

```
global
  daemon

defaults
  mode tcp
  timeout connect 5s
  timeout client 50s
  timeout server 50s

listen very-basic-load-balancer
  bind *:80
  server blue color.blue.svc:80
  server green color.green.svc:80

# Note: the services above must exist,
# otherwise HAproxy won't start.

```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Creating the ConfigMap

.lab[

- Create a ConfigMap named `haproxy` and holding the configuration file:
  ```bash
  kubectl create configmap haproxy --from-file=~/container.training/k8s/haproxy.cfg
  ```

- Check what our configmap looks like:
  ```bash
  kubectl get configmap haproxy -o yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Using the ConfigMap

Here is [k8s/haproxy.yaml](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/tree/master/k8s/haproxy.yaml), a Pod manifest using that ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: haproxy
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: config
    configMap:
      name: haproxy
  containers:
  - name: haproxy
    image: haproxy:1
    volumeMounts:
    - name: config
      mountPath: /usr/local/etc/haproxy/


```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Creating the Pod

.lab[

- Create the HAProxy Pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/haproxy.yaml
  ```

<!-- ```hide kubectl wait pod haproxy --for condition=ready``` -->

- Check the IP address allocated to the pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod haproxy -o wide
  IP=$(kubectl get pod haproxy -o json | jq -r .status.podIP)
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Testing our load balancer

- If everything went well, when we should see a perfect round robin

  (one request to `blue`, one request to `green`, one request to `blue`, etc.)

.lab[

- Send a few requests:
  ```bash
  for i in $(seq 10); do
  curl $IP
  done
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Exposing configmaps with the downward API

- We are going to run a Docker registry on a custom port

- By default, the registry listens on port 5000

- This can be changed by setting environment variable `REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR`

- We are going to store the port number in a configmap

- Then we will expose that configmap as a container environment variable

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Creating the configmap

.lab[

- Our configmap will have a single key, `http.addr`:
  ```bash
  kubectl create configmap registry --from-literal=http.addr=0.0.0.0:80
  ```

- Check our configmap:
  ```bash
  kubectl get configmap registry -o yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Using the configmap

We are going to use the following pod definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: registry
spec:
  containers:
  - name: registry
    image: registry
    env:
    - name: REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: registry
          key: http.addr


```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Using the configmap

- The resource definition from the previous slide is in [k8s/registry.yaml](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/tree/master/k8s/registry.yaml)

.lab[

- Create the registry pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/registry.yaml
  ```

<!-- ```hide kubectl wait pod registry --for condition=ready``` -->

- Check the IP address allocated to the pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod registry -o wide
  IP=$(kubectl get pod registry -o json | jq -r .status.podIP)
  ```

- Confirm that the registry is available on port 80:
  ```bash
  curl $IP/v2/_catalog
  ```

# Managing secrets

- Sometimes our code needs sensitive information:

  - passwords

  - API tokens

  - TLS keys

  - ...

- *Secrets* can be used for that purpose

- Secrets and ConfigMaps are very similar

.debug[[k8s/secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/secrets.md)]
---

## Similarities between ConfigMap and Secrets

- ConfigMap and Secrets are key-value maps

  (a Secret can contain zero, one, or many key-value pairs)

- They can both be exposed with the downward API or volumes

- They can both be created with YAML or with a CLI command

  (`kubectl create configmap` / `kubectl create secret`)

.debug[[k8s/secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/secrets.md)]
---

## ConfigMap and Secrets are different resources

- They can have different RBAC permissions

  (e.g. the default `view` role can read ConfigMaps but not Secrets)

- They indicate a different *intent*:

  *"You should use secrets for things which are actually secret like API keys, 
  credentials, etc., and use config map for not-secret configuration data."*

  *"In the future there will likely be some differentiators for secrets like rotation or support for backing the secret API w/ HSMs, etc."*

  (Source: [the author of both features](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36925553/580281
))

.debug[[k8s/secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/secrets.md)]
---

## Secrets have an optional *type*

- The type indicates which keys must exist in the secrets, for instance:

  `kubernetes.io/tls` requires `tls.crt` and `tls.key`

  `kubernetes.io/basic-auth` requires `username` and `password`

  `kubernetes.io/ssh-auth` requires `ssh-privatekey`

  `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` requires `.dockerconfigjson`

  `kubernetes.io/service-account-token` requires `token`, `namespace`, `ca.crt`

  (the whole list is in [the documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#secret-types))

- This is merely for our (human) convenience:

  ‚ÄúAh yes, this secret is a ...‚Äù

.debug[[k8s/secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/secrets.md)]
---

## Accessing private repositories

- Let's see how to access an image on private registry!

- These images are protected by a username + password

  (on some registries, it's token + password, but it's the same thing)

- To access a private image, we need to:

  - create a secret

  - reference that secret in a Pod template

  - or reference that secret in a ServiceAccount used by a Pod

.debug[[k8s/secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/secrets.md)]
---

## In practice

- Let's try to access an image on a private registry!

  - image = docker-registry.enix.io/jpetazzo/private:latest
  - user = reader
  - password = VmQvqdtXFwXfyy4Jb5DR

.lab[

- Create a Deployment using that image:
  ```bash
    kubectl create deployment priv \
            --image=docker-registry.enix.io/jpetazzo/private
  ```

- Check that the Pod won't start:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --selector=app=priv
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/secrets.md)]
---

## Creating a secret

- Let's create a secret with the information provided earlier

.lab[

- Create the registry secret:
  ```bash
    kubectl create secret docker-registry enix \
            --docker-server=docker-registry.enix.io \
            --docker-username=reader \
            --docker-password=VmQvqdtXFwXfyy4Jb5DR
  ```

]

Why do we have to specify the registry address?

If we use multiple sets of credentials for different registries, it prevents leaking the credentials of one registry to *another* registry.

.debug[[k8s/secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/secrets.md)]
---

## Using the secret

- The first way to use a secret is to add it to `imagePullSecrets`

  (in the `spec` section of a Pod template)

.lab[

- Patch the `priv` Deployment that we created earlier:
  ```bash
    kubectl patch deploy priv --patch='
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          imagePullSecrets:
          - name: enix
    '
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/secrets.md)]
---

## Checking the results

.lab[

- Confirm that our Pod can now start correctly:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --selector=app=priv
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/secrets.md)]
---

## Another way to use the secret

- We can add the secret to the ServiceAccount

- This is convenient to automatically use credentials for *all* pods

  (as long as they're using a specific ServiceAccount, of course)

.lab[

- Add the secret to the ServiceAccount:
  ```bash
    kubectl patch serviceaccount default --patch='
    imagePullSecrets:
    - name: enix
    '
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/secrets.md)]
---

## Secrets are displayed with base64 encoding

- When shown with e.g. `kubectl get secrets -o yaml`, secrets are base64-encoded

- Likewise, when defining it with YAML, `data` values are base64-encoded

- Example:
  ```yaml
    kind: Secret
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: pin-codes
    data:
      onetwothreefour: MTIzNA==
      zerozerozerozero: MDAwMA==
  ```

- Keep in mind that this is just *encoding*, not *encryption*

- It is very easy to [automatically extract and decode secrets](https://medium.com/@mveritym/decoding-kubernetes-secrets-60deed7a96a3)

.debug[[k8s/secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/secrets.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Using `stringData`

- When creating a Secret, it is possible to bypass base64

- Just use `stringData` instead of `data`:
  ```yaml
    kind: Secret
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: pin-codes
    stringData:
      onetwothreefour: 1234
      zerozerozerozero: 0000
  ```

- It will show up as base64 if you `kubectl get -o yaml`

- No `type` was specified, so it defaults to `Opaque`

.debug[[k8s/secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/secrets.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Encryption at rest

- It is possible to [encrypted secrets at rest](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/)

- This means that secrets will be safe if someone ...

  - steals our etcd servers

  - steals our backups

  - snoops the e.g. iSCSI link between our etcd servers and SAN

- However, starting the API server will now require human intervention

  (to provide the decryption keys)

- This is only for extremely regulated environments (military, nation states...)

.debug[[k8s/secrets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/secrets.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Immutable ConfigMaps and Secrets

- Since Kubernetes 1.19, it is possible to mark a ConfigMap or Secret as *immutable*

  ```bash
  kubectl patch configmap xyz --patch='{"immutable": true}'
  ```

- This brings performance improvements when using lots of ConfigMaps and Secrets

  (lots = tens of thousands)

- Once a ConfigMap or Secret has been marked as immutable:

  - its content cannot be changed anymore
  - the `immutable` field can't be changed back either
  - the only way to change it is to delete and re-create it
  - Pods using it will have to be re-created as well

# Centralized logging

- Using `kubectl` or `stern` is simple; but it has drawbacks:

  - when a node goes down, its logs are not available anymore

  - we can only dump or stream logs; we want to search/index/count...

- We want to send all our logs to a single place

- We want to parse them (e.g. for HTTP logs) and index them

- We want a nice web dashboard

--

- We are going to deploy an EFK stack

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## What is EFK?

- EFK is three components:

  - ElasticSearch (to store and index log entries)

  - Fluentd (to get container logs, process them, and put them in ElasticSearch)

  - Kibana (to view/search log entries with a nice UI)

- The only component that we need to access from outside the cluster will be Kibana

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## Deploying EFK on our cluster

- We are going to use a YAML file describing all the required resources

.lab[

- Load the YAML file into our cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/efk.yaml
  ```

]

If we [look at the YAML file](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/k8s/efk.yaml), we see that
it creates a daemon set, two deployments, two services,
and a few roles and role bindings (to give fluentd the required permissions).

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## The itinerary of a log line (before Fluentd)

- A container writes a line on stdout or stderr

- Both are typically piped to the container engine (Docker or otherwise)

- The container engine reads the line, and sends it to a logging driver

- The timestamp and stream (stdout or stderr) is added to the log line

- With the default configuration for Kubernetes, the line is written to a JSON file

  (`/var/log/containers/pod-name_namespace_container-id.log`)

- That file is read when we invoke `kubectl logs`; we can access it directly too

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## The itinerary of a log line (with Fluentd)

- Fluentd runs on each node (thanks to a daemon set)

- It bind-mounts `/var/log/containers` from the host (to access these files)

- It continuously scans this directory for new files; reads them; parses them

- Each log line becomes a JSON object, fully annotated with extra information:
  <br/>container id, pod name, Kubernetes labels...

- These JSON objects are stored in ElasticSearch

- ElasticSearch indexes the JSON objects

- We can access the logs through Kibana (and perform searches, counts, etc.)

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## Accessing Kibana

- Kibana offers a web interface that is relatively straightforward

- Let's check it out!

.lab[

- Check which `NodePort` was allocated to Kibana:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc kibana
  ```

- With our web browser, connect to Kibana

]

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## Using Kibana

*Note: this is not a Kibana workshop! So this section is deliberately very terse.*

- The first time you connect to Kibana, you must "configure an index pattern"

- Just use the one that is suggested, `@timestamp`.red[*]

- Then click "Discover" (in the top-left corner)

- You should see container logs

- Advice: in the left column, select a few fields to display, e.g.:

  `kubernetes.host`, `kubernetes.pod_name`, `stream`, `log`

.red[*]If you don't see `@timestamp`, it's probably because no logs exist yet.
<br/>Wait a bit, and double-check the logging pipeline!

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## Caveat emptor

We are using EFK because it is relatively straightforward
to deploy on Kubernetes, without having to redeploy or reconfigure
our cluster. But it doesn't mean that it will always be the best
option for your use-case. If you are running Kubernetes in the
cloud, you might consider using the cloud provider's logging
infrastructure (if it can be integrated with Kubernetes).

The deployment method that we will use here has been simplified:
there is only one ElasticSearch node. In a real deployment, you
might use a cluster, both for performance and reliability reasons.
But this is outside of the scope of this chapter.

The YAML file that we used creates all the resources in the
`default` namespace, for simplicity. In a real scenario, you will
create the resources in the `kube-system` namespace or in a dedicated namespace.

# Stateful sets

- Stateful sets are a type of resource in the Kubernetes API

  (like pods, deployments, services...)

- They offer mechanisms to deploy scaled stateful applications

- At a first glance, they look like Deployments:

  - a stateful set defines a pod spec and a number of replicas *R*

  - it will make sure that *R* copies of the pod are running

  - that number can be changed while the stateful set is running

  - updating the pod spec will cause a rolling update to happen

- But they also have some significant differences

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Stateful sets unique features

- Pods in a stateful set are numbered (from 0 to *R-1*) and ordered

- They are started and updated in order (from 0 to *R-1*)

- A pod is started (or updated) only when the previous one is ready

- They are stopped in reverse order (from *R-1* to 0)

- Each pod knows its identity (i.e. which number it is in the set)

- Each pod can discover the IP address of the others easily

- The pods can persist data on attached volumes

ü§î Wait a minute ... Can't we already attach volumes to pods and deployments?

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Revisiting volumes

- [Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) are used for many purposes:

  - sharing data between containers in a pod

  - exposing configuration information and secrets to containers

  - accessing storage systems

- Let's see examples of the latter usage

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Volumes types

- There are many [types of volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#types-of-volumes) available:

  - public cloud storage (GCEPersistentDisk, AWSElasticBlockStore, AzureDisk...)

  - private cloud storage (Cinder, VsphereVolume...)

  - traditional storage systems (NFS, iSCSI, FC...)

  - distributed storage (Ceph, Glusterfs, Portworx...)

- Using a persistent volume requires:

  - creating the volume out-of-band (outside of the Kubernetes API)

  - referencing the volume in the pod description, with all its parameters

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Using a cloud volume

Here is a pod definition using an AWS EBS volume (that has to be created first):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-using-my-ebs-volume
spec:
  containers:
  - image: ...
    name: container-using-my-ebs-volume
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /my-ebs
      name: my-ebs-volume
  volumes:
  - name: my-ebs-volume
    awsElasticBlockStore:
      volumeID: vol-049df61146c4d7901
      fsType: ext4
```

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Using an NFS volume

Here is another example using a volume on an NFS server:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-using-my-nfs-volume
spec:
  containers:
  - image: ...
    name: container-using-my-nfs-volume
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /my-nfs
      name: my-nfs-volume
  volumes:
  - name: my-nfs-volume
    nfs:
      server: 192.168.0.55
      path: "/exports/assets"
```

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Shortcomings of volumes

- Their lifecycle (creation, deletion...) is managed outside of the Kubernetes API

  (we can't just use `kubectl apply/create/delete/...` to manage them)

- If a Deployment uses a volume, all replicas end up using the same volume

- That volume must then support concurrent access

  - some volumes do (e.g. NFS servers support multiple read/write access)

  - some volumes support concurrent reads

  - some volumes support concurrent access for colocated pods

- What we really need is a way for each replica to have its own volume

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Individual volumes

- The Pods of a Stateful set can have individual volumes

  (i.e. in a Stateful set with 3 replicas, there will be 3 volumes)

- These volumes can be either:

  - allocated from a pool of pre-existing volumes (disks, partitions ...)

  - created dynamically using a storage system

- This introduces a bunch of new Kubernetes resource types:

  Persistent Volumes, Persistent Volume Claims, Storage Classes

  (and also `volumeClaimTemplates`, that appear within Stateful Set manifests!)

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Stateful set recap

- A Stateful sets manages a number of identical pods

  (like a Deployment)

- These pods are numbered, and started/upgraded/stopped in a specific order

- These pods are aware of their number

  (e.g., #0 can decide to be the primary, and #1 can be secondary)

- These pods can find the IP addresses of the other pods in the set

  (through a *headless service*)

- These pods can each have their own persistent storage

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Obtaining per-pod storage

- Stateful Sets can have *persistent volume claim templates*

  (declared in `spec.volumeClaimTemplates` in the Stateful set manifest)

- A claim template will create one Persistent Volume Claim per pod

  (the PVC will be named `<claim-name>.<stateful-set-name>.<pod-index>`)

- Persistent Volume Claims are matched 1-to-1 with Persistent Volumes

- Persistent Volume provisioning can be done:

  - automatically (by leveraging *dynamic provisioning* with a Storage Class)

  - manually (human operator creates the volumes ahead of time, or when needed)

# Running a Consul cluster

- Here is a good use-case for Stateful sets!

- We are going to deploy a Consul cluster with 3 nodes

- Consul is a highly-available key/value store

  (like etcd or Zookeeper)

- One easy way to bootstrap a cluster is to tell each node:

  - the addresses of other nodes

  - how many nodes are expected (to know when quorum is reached)

.debug[[k8s/consul.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/consul.md)]
---

## Bootstrapping a Consul cluster

*After reading the Consul documentation carefully (and/or asking around),
we figure out the minimal command-line to run our Consul cluster.*

```
consul agent -data-dir=/consul/data -client=0.0.0.0 -server -ui \
       -bootstrap-expect=3 \
       -retry-join=`X.X.X.X` \
       -retry-join=`Y.Y.Y.Y`
```

- Replace X.X.X.X and Y.Y.Y.Y with the addresses of other nodes

- A node can add its own address (it will work fine)

- ... Which means that we can use the same command-line on all nodes (convenient!)

.debug[[k8s/consul.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/consul.md)]
---

## Cloud Auto-join

- Since version 1.4.0, Consul can use the Kubernetes API to find its peers

- This is called [Cloud Auto-join]

- Instead of passing an IP address, we need to pass a parameter like this:

  ```
  consul agent -retry-join "provider=k8s label_selector=\"app=consul\""
  ```

- Consul needs to be able to talk to the Kubernetes API

- We can provide a `kubeconfig` file

- If Consul runs in a pod, it will use the *service account* of the pod

[Cloud Auto-join]: https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/cloud-auto-join.html#kubernetes-k8s-

.debug[[k8s/consul.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/consul.md)]
---

## Setting up Cloud auto-join

- We need to create a service account for Consul

- We need to create a role that can `list` and `get` pods

- We need to bind that role to the service account

- And of course, we need to make sure that Consul pods use that service account

.debug[[k8s/consul.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/consul.md)]
---

## Putting it all together

- The file `k8s/consul-1.yaml` defines the required resources

  (service account, role, role binding, service, stateful set)

- Inspired by this [excellent tutorial](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/consul-on-kubernetes) by Kelsey Hightower

  (many features from the original tutorial were removed for simplicity)

.debug[[k8s/consul.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/consul.md)]
---

## Running our Consul cluster

- We'll use the provided YAML file

.lab[

- Create the stateful set and associated service:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/consul-1.yaml
  ```

- Check the logs as the pods come up one after another:
  ```bash
  stern consul
  ```

<!--
```wait Synced node info```
```key ^C```
-->

- Check the health of the cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl exec consul-0 -- consul members
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/consul.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/consul.md)]
---

## Caveats

- The scheduler may place two Consul pods on the same node

  - if that node fails, we lose two Consul pods at the same time
  - this will cause the cluster to fail

- Scaling down the cluster will cause it to fail

  - when a Consul member leaves the cluster, it needs to inform the others
  - otherwise, the last remaining node doesn't have quorum and stops functioning

- This Consul cluster doesn't use real persistence yet

  - data is stored in the containers' ephemeral filesystem
  - if a pod fails, its replacement starts from a blank slate

.debug[[k8s/consul.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/consul.md)]
---

## Improving pod placement

- We need to tell the scheduler:

  *do not put two of these pods on the same node!*

- This is done with an `affinity` section like the following one:
  ```yaml
    affinity:
      podAntiAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - labelSelector:
              matchLabels:
                app: consul
            topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
  ```

.debug[[k8s/consul.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/consul.md)]
---

## Using a lifecycle hook

- When a Consul member leaves the cluster, it needs to execute:
  ```bash
  consul leave
  ```

- This is done with a `lifecycle` section like the following one:
  ```yaml
    lifecycle:
      preStop:
        exec:
          command: [ "sh", "-c", "consul leave" ]
  ```

.debug[[k8s/consul.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/consul.md)]
---

## Running a better Consul cluster

- Let's try to add the scheduling constraint and lifecycle hook

- We can do that in the same namespace or another one (as we like)

- If we do that in the same namespace, we will see a rolling update

  (pods will be replaced one by one)

.lab[

- Deploy a better Consul cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/consul-2.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/consul.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/consul.md)]
---

## Still no persistence, though

- We aren't using actual persistence yet

  (no `volumeClaimTemplate`, Persistent Volume, etc.)

- What happens if we lose a pod?

  - a new pod gets rescheduled (with an empty state)

  - the new pod tries to connect to the two others

  - it will be accepted (after 1-2 minutes of instability)

  - and it will retrieve the data from the other pods

.debug[[k8s/consul.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/consul.md)]
---

## Failure modes

- What happens if we lose two pods?

  - manual repair will be required

  - we will need to instruct the remaining one to act solo

  - then rejoin new pods

- What happens if we lose three pods? (aka all of them)

  - we lose all the data (ouch)

# PV, PVC, and Storage Classes

- When an application needs storage, it creates a PersistentVolumeClaim

  (either directly, or through a volume claim template in a Stateful Set)

- The PersistentVolumeClaim is initially `Pending`

- Kubernetes then looks for a suitable PersistentVolume

  (maybe one is immediately available; maybe we need to wait for provisioning)

- Once a suitable PersistentVolume is found, the PVC becomes `Bound`

- The PVC can then be used by a Pod

  (as long as the PVC is `Pending`, the Pod cannot run)

.debug[[k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md)]
---

## Access modes

- PV and PVC have *access modes*:

  - ReadWriteOnce (only one node can access the volume at a time)

  - ReadWriteMany (multiple nodes can access the volume simultaneously)

  - ReadOnlyMany (multiple nodes can access, but they can't write)

  - ReadWriteOncePod (only one pod can access the volume; new in Kubernetes 1.22)

- A PVC lists the access modes that it requires

- A PV lists the access modes that it supports

‚ö†Ô∏è A PV with only ReadWriteMany won't satisfy a PVC with ReadWriteOnce!

.debug[[k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md)]
---

## Capacity

- A PVC must express a storage size request

  (field `spec.resources.requests.storage`, in bytes)

- A PV must express its size

  (field `spec.capacity.storage`, in bytes)

- Kubernetes will only match a PV and PVC if the PV is big enough

- These fields are only used for "matchmaking" purposes:

  - nothing prevents the Pod mounting the PVC from using more space

  - nothing requires the PV to actually be that big

.debug[[k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md)]
---

## Storage Class

- What if we have multiple storage systems available?

  (e.g. NFS and iSCSI; or AzureFile and AzureDisk; or Cinder and Ceph...)

- What if we have a storage system with multiple tiers?

  (e.g. SAN with RAID1 and RAID5; general purpose vs. io optimized EBS...)

- Kubernetes lets us define *storage classes* to represent these

  (see if you have any available at the moment with `kubectl get storageclasses`)

.debug[[k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md)]
---

## Using storage classes

- Optionally, each PV and each PVC can reference a StorageClass

  (field `spec.storageClassName`)

- When creating a PVC, specifying a StorageClass means

  ‚Äúuse that particular storage system to provision the volume!‚Äù

- Storage classes are necessary for [dynamic provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/)

  (but we can also ignore them and perform manual provisioning)

.debug[[k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md)]
---

## Default storage class

- We can define a *default storage class*

  (by annotating it with `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class=true`)

- When a PVC is created,

  **IF** it doesn't indicate which storage class to use

  **AND** there is a default storage class

  **THEN** the PVC `storageClassName` is set to the default storage class

.debug[[k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md)]
---

## Additional constraints

- A PersistentVolumeClaim can also specify a volume selector

  (referring to labels on the PV)

- A PersistentVolume can also be created with a `claimRef`

  (indicating to which PVC it should be bound)

.debug[[k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Which PV gets associated to a PVC?

- The PV must be `Available`

- The PV must satisfy the PVC constraints

  (access mode, size, optional selector, optional storage class)

- The PVs with the closest access mode are picked

- Then the PVs with the closest size

- It is possible to specify a `claimRef` when creating a PV

  (this will associate it to the specified PVC, but only if the PV satisfies all the requirements of the PVC; otherwise another PV might end up being picked)

- For all the details about the PersistentVolumeClaimBinder, check [this doc](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/storage/persistent-storage.md#matching-and-binding)

.debug[[k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md)]
---

## Creating a PVC

- Let's create a standalone PVC and see what happens!

.lab[

- Check if we have a StorageClass:
  ```bash
  kubectl get storageclasses
  ```

- Create the PVC:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f ~/container.training/k8s/pvc.yaml
  ```

- Check the PVC:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pvc
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md)]
---

## Four possibilities

1. If we have a default StorageClass with *immediate* binding:

   *a PV was created and associated to the PVC*

2. If we have a default StorageClass that *waits for first consumer*:

  *the PVC is still `Pending` but has a `STORAGECLASS`* ‚ö†Ô∏è

3. If we don't have a default StorageClass:

  *the PVC is still `Pending`, without a `STORAGECLASS`*

4. If we have a StorageClass, but it doesn't work:

  *the PVC is still `Pending` but has a `STORAGECLASS`* ‚ö†Ô∏è

.debug[[k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md)]
---

## Immediate vs WaitForFirstConsumer

- Immediate = as soon as there is a `Pending` PVC, create a PV

- What if:

  - the PV is only available on a node (e.g. local volume)

  - ...or on a subset of nodes (e.g. SAN HBA, EBS AZ...)

  - the Pod that will use the PVC has scheduling constraints

  - these constraints turn out to be incompatible with the PV

- WaitForFirstConsumer = don't provision the PV until a Pod mounts the PVC

.debug[[k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md)]
---

## Using the PVC

- Let's mount the PVC in a Pod

- We will use a stray Pod (no Deployment, StatefulSet, etc.)

- We will use [k8s/mounter.yaml](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/tree/master/k8s/mounter.yaml), shown on the next slide

- We'll need to update the `claimName`! ‚ö†Ô∏è

.debug[[k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md)]
---

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  generateName: mounter-
  labels:
    container.training/mounter: ""
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: pvc
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: my-pvc-XYZ45
  containers:
  - name: mounter
    image: alpine
    stdin: true
    tty: true
    volumeMounts:
    - name: pvc
      mountPath: /pvc
    workingDir: /pvc

```

.debug[[k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md)]
---

## Running the Pod

.lab[

- Edit the `mounter.yaml` manifest

- Update the `claimName` to put the name of our PVC

- Create the Pod

- Check the status of the PV and PVC

]

Note: this "mounter" Pod can be useful to inspect the content of a PVC.

.debug[[k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md)]
---

## Scenario 1 & 2

If we have a default Storage Class that can provision PVC dynamically...

- We should now have a new PV

- The PV and the PVC should be `Bound` together

.debug[[k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md)]
---

## Scenario 3

If we don't have a default Storage Class, we must create the PV manually.

```bash
kubectl create -f ~/container.training/k8s/pv.yaml
```

After a few seconds, check that the PV and PVC are bound:

```bash
kubectl get pv,pvc
```

.debug[[k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md)]
---

## Scenario 4

If our default Storage Class can't provision a PV, let's do it manually.

The PV must specify the correct `storageClassName`.

```bash
STORAGECLASS=$(kubectl get pvc --selector=container.training/pvc \
               -o jsonpath={..storageClassName})
kubectl patch -f ~/container.training/k8s/pv.yaml --dry-run=client -o yaml \
        --patch '{"spec": {"storageClassName": "'$STORAGECLASS'"}}' \
        | kubectl create -f-
```

Check that the PV and PVC are bound:

```bash
kubectl get pv,pvc
```

.debug[[k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md)]
---

## Checking the Pod

- If the PVC was `Pending`, then the Pod was `Pending` too

- Once the PVC is `Bound`, the Pod can be scheduled and can run

- Once the Pod is `Running`, check it out with `kubectl attach -ti`

.debug[[k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/pv-pvc-sc.md)]
---

## PV and PVC lifecycle

- We can't delete a PV if it's `Bound`

- If we `kubectl delete` it, it goes to `Terminating` state

- We can't delete a PVC if it's in use by a Pod

- Likewise, if we `kubectl delete` it, it goes to `Terminating` state

- Deletion is prevented by *finalizers*

  (=like a post-it note saying ‚Äúdon't delete me!‚Äù)

- When the mounting Pods are deleted, their PVCs are freed up

- When PVCs are deleted, their PVs are freed up

## Putting it all together

- We want to run that Consul cluster *and* actually persist data

- We'll use a StatefulSet that will leverage PV and PVC

- If we have a dynamic provisioner:

  *the cluster will come up right away*

- If we don't have a dynamic provisioner:

  *we will need to create Persistent Volumes manually*

.debug[[k8s/volume-claim-templates.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volume-claim-templates.md)]
---

## Persistent Volume Claims and Stateful sets

- A Stateful set can define one (or more) `volumeClaimTemplate`

- Each `volumeClaimTemplate` will create one Persistent Volume Claim per Pod

- Each Pod will therefore have its own individual volume

- These volumes are numbered (like the Pods)

- Example:

  - a Stateful set is named `consul`
  - it is scaled to replicas
  - it has a `volumeClaimTemplate` named `data`
  - then it will create pods `consul-0`, `consul-1`, `consul-2`
  - these pods will have volumes named `data`, referencing PersistentVolumeClaims
    named `data-consul-0`, `data-consul-1`, `data-consul-2`

.debug[[k8s/volume-claim-templates.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volume-claim-templates.md)]
---

## Persistent Volume Claims are sticky

- When updating the stateful set (e.g. image upgrade), each pod keeps its volume

- When pods get rescheduled (e.g. node failure), they keep their volume

  (this requires a storage system that is not node-local)

- These volumes are not automatically deleted

  (when the stateful set is scaled down or deleted)

- If a stateful set is scaled back up later, the pods get their data back

.debug[[k8s/volume-claim-templates.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volume-claim-templates.md)]
---

## Deploying Consul

- Let's use a new manifest for our Consul cluster

- The only differences between that file and the previous one are:

  - `volumeClaimTemplate` defined in the Stateful Set spec

  - the corresponding `volumeMounts` in the Pod spec

.lab[

- Apply the persistent Consul YAML file:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/consul-3.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/volume-claim-templates.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volume-claim-templates.md)]
---

## No dynamic provisioner

- If we don't have a dynamic provisioner, we need to create the PVs

- We are going to use local volumes

  (similar conceptually to `hostPath` volumes)

- We can use local volumes without installing extra plugins

- However, they are tied to a node

- If that node goes down, the volume becomes unavailable

.debug[[k8s/volume-claim-templates.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volume-claim-templates.md)]
---

## Observing the situation

- Let's look at Persistent Volume Claims and Pods

.lab[

- Check that we now have an unbound Persistent Volume Claim:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pvc
  ```

- We don't have any Persistent Volume:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pv
  ```

- The Pod `consul-0` is not scheduled yet:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide
  ```

]

*Hint: leave these commands running with `-w` in different windows.*

.debug[[k8s/volume-claim-templates.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volume-claim-templates.md)]
---

## Explanations

- In a Stateful Set, the Pods are started one by one

- `consul-1` won't be created until `consul-0` is running

- `consul-0` has a dependency on an unbound Persistent Volume Claim

- The scheduler won't schedule the Pod until the PVC is bound

  (because the PVC might be bound to a volume that is only available on a subset of nodes; for instance EBS are tied to an availability zone)

.debug[[k8s/volume-claim-templates.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volume-claim-templates.md)]
---

## Creating Persistent Volumes

- Let's create 3 local directories (`/mnt/consul`) on node2, node3, node4

- Then create 3 Persistent Volumes corresponding to these directories

.lab[

- Create the local directories:
  ```bash
    for NODE in node2 node3 node4; do
      ssh $NODE sudo mkdir -p /mnt/consul
    done
  ```

- Create the PV objects:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/volumes-for-consul.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/volume-claim-templates.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volume-claim-templates.md)]
---

## Check our Consul cluster

- The PVs that we created will be automatically matched with the PVCs

- Once a PVC is bound, its pod can start normally

- Once the pod `consul-0` has started, `consul-1` can be created, etc.

- Eventually, our Consul cluster is up, and backend by "persistent" volumes

.lab[

- Check that our Consul clusters has 3 members indeed:
  ```bash
  kubectl exec consul-0 -- consul members
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/volume-claim-templates.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volume-claim-templates.md)]
---

## Devil is in the details (1/2)

- The size of the Persistent Volumes is bogus

  (it is used when matching PVs and PVCs together, but there is no actual quota or limit)

- The Pod might end up using more than the requested size

- The PV may or may not have the capacity that it's advertising

- It works well with dynamically provisioned block volumes

- ...Less so in other scenarios!

.debug[[k8s/volume-claim-templates.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volume-claim-templates.md)]
---

## Devil is in the details (2/2)

- This specific example worked because we had exactly 1 free PV per node:

  - if we had created multiple PVs per node ...

  - we could have ended with two PVCs bound to PVs on the same node ...

  - which would have required two pods to be on the same node ...

  - which is forbidden by the anti-affinity constraints in the StatefulSet

- To avoid that, we need to associated the PVs with a Storage Class that has:
  ```yaml
  volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
  ```
  (this means that a PVC will be bound to a PV only after being used by a Pod)

- See [this blog post](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/04/13/local-persistent-volumes-beta/) for more details

.debug[[k8s/volume-claim-templates.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volume-claim-templates.md)]
---

## If we have a dynamic provisioner

These are the steps when dynamic provisioning happens:

1. The Stateful Set creates PVCs according to the `volumeClaimTemplate`.

2. The Stateful Set creates Pods using these PVCs.

3. The PVCs are automatically annotated with our Storage Class.

4. The dynamic provisioner provisions volumes and creates the corresponding PVs.

5. The PersistentVolumeClaimBinder associates the PVs and the PVCs together.

6. PVCs are now bound, the Pods can start.

.debug[[k8s/volume-claim-templates.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volume-claim-templates.md)]
---

## Validating persistence (1)

- When the StatefulSet is deleted, the PVC and PV still exist

- And if we recreate an identical StatefulSet, the PVC and PV are reused

- Let's see that!

.lab[

- Put some data in Consul:
  ```bash
  kubectl exec consul-0 -- consul kv put answer 42
  ```

- Delete the Consul cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete -f ~/container.training/k8s/consul-3.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/volume-claim-templates.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volume-claim-templates.md)]
---

## Validating persistence (2)

.lab[

- Wait until the last Pod is deleted:
  ```bash
  kubectl wait pod consul-0 --for=delete
  ```

- Check that PV and PVC are still here:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pv,pvc
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/volume-claim-templates.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volume-claim-templates.md)]
---

## Validating persistence (3)

.lab[

- Re-create the cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/consul-3.yaml
  ```

- Wait until it's up

- Then access the key that we set earlier:
  ```bash
  kubectl exec consul-0 -- consul kv get answer
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/volume-claim-templates.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/volume-claim-templates.md)]
---

## Cleaning up

- PV and PVC don't get deleted automatically

- This is great (less risk of accidental data loss)

- This is not great (storage usage increases)

- Managing PVC lifecycle:

  - remove them manually

  - add their StatefulSet to their `ownerReferences`

  - delete the Namespace that they belong to

# OpenEBS 

 - [OpenEBS] is a popular open-source storage solution for Kubernetes

 - Uses the concept of "Container Attached Storage"

   (1 volume = 1 dedicated controller pod + a set of replica pods)

 - Supports a wide range of storage engines:

   - LocalPV: local volumes (hostpath or device), no replication

   - Jiva: for lighter workloads with basic cloning/snapshotting

   - cStor: more powerful engine that also supports resizing, RAID, disk pools ...

   - [Mayastor]: newer, even more powerful engine with NVMe and vhost-user support

[OpenEBS]: https://openebs.io/

[Mayastor]: https://github.com/openebs/MayaStor#mayastor

.debug[[k8s/openebs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/openebs.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## What are all these storage engines?

- LocalPV is great if we want good performance, no replication, easy setup

  (it is similar to the Rancher local path provisioner)

- Jiva is great if we want replication and easy setup

  (data is stored in containers' filesystems)

- cStor is more powerful and flexible, but requires more extensive setup

- Mayastor is designed to achieve extreme performance levels

  (with the right hardware and disks)

- The OpenEBS documentation has a [good comparison of engines] to help us pick

[good comparison of engines]: https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/casengines.html#cstor-vs-jiva-vs-localpv-features-comparison

.debug[[k8s/openebs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/openebs.md)]
---

## Installing OpenEBS with Helm

- The OpenEBS control plane can be installed with Helm

- It will run as a set of containers on Kubernetes worker nodes

.lab[

  - Install OpenEBS:
  ```bash  
    helm upgrade --install openebs openebs \
         --repo https://openebs.github.io/charts \
         --namespace openebs --create-namespace \
         --version 2.12.9
  ```
]

‚ö†Ô∏è We stick to OpenEBS 2.x because 3.x requires additional configuration.

.debug[[k8s/openebs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/openebs.md)]
---

## Checking what was installed

- Wait a little bit ...

.lab[

- Look at the pods in the `openebs` namespace:
  ```bash  
      kubectl get pods --namespace openebs
  ```

- And the StorageClasses that were created:
  ```bash  
      kubectl get sc
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/openebs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/openebs.md)]
---

## The default StorageClasses

- OpenEBS typically creates three default StorageClasses

- `openebs-jiva-default` provisions 3 replicated Jiva pods per volume

  - data is stored in `/openebs` in the replica pods
  - `/openebs` is a localpath volume mapped to `/var/openebs/pvc-...` on the node

- `openebs-hostpath` uses LocalPV with local directories

  - volumes are hostpath volumes created in `/var/openebs/local` on each node

- `openebs-device` uses LocalPV with local block devices

  - requires available disks and/or a bit of extra configuration
  - the default configuration filters out loop, LVM, MD devices

.debug[[k8s/openebs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/openebs.md)]
---

## When do we need custom StorageClasses?

- To store LocalPV hostpath volumes on a different path on the host

- To change the number of replicated Jiva pods

- To use a different Jiva pool

  (i.e. a different path on the host to store the Jiva volumes)

- To create a cStor pool

- ...

.debug[[k8s/openebs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/openebs.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Defining a custom StorageClass

Example for a LocalPV hostpath class using an extra mount on `/mnt/vol001`:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: localpv-hostpath-mntvol001
  annotations:
    openebs.io/cas-type: local
    cas.openebs.io/config: |
      - name: BasePath
        value: "/mnt/vol001"
      - name: StorageType
        value: "hostpath"
provisioner: openebs.io/local
```

- `provisioner` needs to be set accordingly
- Storage engine is chosen by specifying the annotation `openebs.io/cas-type`
- Storage engine configuration is set with the annotation `cas.openebs.io/config` 

.debug[[k8s/openebs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/openebs.md)]
---

## Checking the default hostpath StorageClass

- Let's inspect the StorageClass that OpenEBS created for us

.lab[

- Let's look at the OpenEBS LocalPV hostpath StorageClass:
  ```bash
  kubectl get storageclass openebs-hostpath -o yaml
  ``` 
]

.debug[[k8s/openebs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/openebs.md)]
---

## Create a host path PVC

- Let's create a Persistent Volume Claim using an explicit StorageClass

.lab[

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1

## Making sure that a PV was created for our PVC

- Normally, the `openebs-hostpath` StorageClass created a PV for our PVC

.lab[

- Look at the PV and PVC:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pv,pvc
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/openebs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/openebs.md)]
---

## Create a Pod to consume the PV

.lab[

- Create a Pod using that PVC:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/openebs-pod.yaml
  ```

- Here are the sections that declare and use the volume:
  ```yaml
    volumes:
    - name: my-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: local-hostpath-pvc
    containers:
    ...  
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /mnt/storage
        name: my-storage
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/openebs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/openebs.md)]
---

## Verify that data is written on the node

- Let's find the file written by the Pod on the node where the Pod is running

.lab[

- Get the worker node where the pod is located
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod openebs-local-hostpath-pod -ojsonpath={.spec.nodeName}
  ```

- SSH into the node

- Check the volume content
  ```bash
  sudo tail /var/openebs/local/pvc-*/greet.txt
  ```

## Heads up!

- The following labs and exercises will use the Jiva storage class

- This storage class creates 3 replicas by default

- It uses *anti-affinity* placement constraits to put these replicas on different nodes

- **This requires a cluster with multiple nodes!**

- It also requires the iSCSI client (aka *initiator*) to be installed on the nodes

- On many platforms, the iSCSI client is preinstalled and will start automatically

- If it doesn't, you might want to check [this documentation page] for details

[this documentation page]: https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/prerequisites.html

.debug[[k8s/openebs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/openebs.md)]
---

## The default StorageClass

- The PVC that we defined earlier specified an explicit StorageClass

- We can also set a default StorageClass

- It will then be used for all PVC that *don't* specify and explicit StorageClass

- This is done with the annotation `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class`

.lab[

- Check if we have a default StorageClass:
  ```bash
  kubectl get storageclasses
  ```
]

- The default StorageClass (if there is one) is shown with `(default)`

.debug[[k8s/openebs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/openebs.md)]
---

## Setting a default StorageClass

- Let's set the default StorageClass to use `openebs-jiva-default`

.lab[

- Remove the annotation (just in case we already have a default class):
  ```bash
  kubectl annotate storageclass storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class- --all
  ```

- Annotate the Jiva StorageClass:
  ```bash
  kubectl annotate storageclasses \
      openebs-jiva-default storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class=true
  ```

- Check the result:
  ```bash
  kuectl get storageclasses
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/openebs.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/openebs.md)]
---

## We're ready now!

- We have a StorageClass that can provision PersistentVolumes

- These PersistentVolumes will be replicated across nodes

- They should be able to withstand single-node failures

# Stateful failover

- How can we achieve true durability?

- How can we store data that would survive the loss of a node?

--

- We need to use Persistent Volumes backed by highly available storage systems

- There are many ways to achieve that:

  - leveraging our cloud's storage APIs

  - using NAS/SAN systems or file servers

  - distributed storage systems

.debug[[k8s/stateful-failover.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/stateful-failover.md)]
---

## Our test scenario

- We will use it to deploy a SQL database (PostgreSQL)

- We will insert some test data in the database

- We will disrupt the node running the database

- We will see how it recovers

## Our Postgres Stateful set

- The next slide shows `k8s/postgres.yaml`

- It defines a Stateful set

- With a `volumeClaimTemplate` requesting a 1 GB volume

- That volume will be mounted to `/var/lib/postgresql/data`

---

## Creating the Stateful set

- Before applying the YAML, watch what's going on with `kubectl get events -w`

.lab[

- Apply that YAML:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/postgres.yaml
  ```

<!-- ```hide kubectl wait pod postgres-0 --for condition=ready``` -->

]

.debug[[k8s/stateful-failover.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/stateful-failover.md)]
---

## Testing our PostgreSQL pod

- We will use `kubectl exec` to get a shell in the pod

- Good to know: we need to use the `postgres` user in the pod

.lab[

- Get a shell in the pod, as the `postgres` user:
  ```bash
  kubectl exec -ti postgres-0 -- su postgres
  ```

<!--
autopilot prompt detection expects $ or # at the beginning of the line.
```wait postgres@postgres```
```keys PS1="\u@\h:\w\n\$ "```
```key ^J```
-->

- Check that default databases have been created correctly:
  ```bash
  psql -l
  ```

]

(This should show us 3 lines: postgres, template0, and template1.)

.debug[[k8s/stateful-failover.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/stateful-failover.md)]
---

## Inserting data in PostgreSQL

- We will create a database and populate it with `pgbench`

.lab[

- Create a database named `demo`:
  ```bash
  createdb demo
  ```

- Populate it with `pgbench`:
  ```bash
  pgbench -i demo
  ```

]

- The `-i` flag means "create tables"

- If you want more data in the test tables, add e.g. `-s 10` (to get 10x more rows)

.debug[[k8s/stateful-failover.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/stateful-failover.md)]
---

## Checking how much data we have now

- The `pgbench` tool inserts rows in table `pgbench_accounts`

.lab[

- Check that the `demo` base exists:
  ```bash
  psql -l
  ```

- Check how many rows we have in `pgbench_accounts`:
  ```bash
  psql demo -c "select count(*) from pgbench_accounts"
  ```

- Check that `pgbench_history` is currently empty:
  ```bash
  psql demo -c "select count(*) from pgbench_history"
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/stateful-failover.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/stateful-failover.md)]
---

## Testing the load generator

- Let's use `pgbench` to generate a few transactions

.lab[

- Run `pgbench` for 10 seconds, reporting progress every second:
  ```bash
  pgbench -P 1 -T 10 demo
  ```

- Check the size of the history table now:
  ```bash
  psql demo -c "select count(*) from pgbench_history"
  ```

]

Note: on small cloud instances, a typical speed is about 100 transactions/second.

.debug[[k8s/stateful-failover.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/stateful-failover.md)]
---

## Generating transactions

- Now let's use `pgbench` to generate more transactions

- While it's running, we will disrupt the database server

.lab[

- Run `pgbench` for 10 minutes, reporting progress every second:
  ```bash
  pgbench -P 1 -T 600 demo
  ```

- You can use a longer time period if you need more time to run the next steps

<!-- ```tmux split-pane -h``` -->

]

.debug[[k8s/stateful-failover.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/stateful-failover.md)]
---

## Find out which node is hosting the database

- We can find that information with `kubectl get pods -o wide`

.lab[

- Check the node running the database:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod postgres-0 -o wide
  ```

]

We are going to disrupt that node.

--

By "disrupt" we mean: "disconnect it from the network".

---

## Node failover

‚ö†Ô∏è This will partially break your cluster!

- We are going to disconnect the node running PostgreSQL from the cluster

- We will see what happens, and how to recover

- We will not reconnect the node to the cluster

- This whole lab will take at least 10-15 minutes (due to various timeouts)

‚ö†Ô∏è Only do this lab at the very end, when you don't want to run anything else after!

.debug[[k8s/stateful-failover.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/stateful-failover.md)]
---

## Disconnecting the node from the cluster

.lab[

- Find out where the Pod is running, and SSH into that node:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod postgres-0 -o jsonpath={.spec.nodeName}
  ssh nodeX
  ```

- Check the name of the network interface:
  ```bash
  sudo ip route ls default
  ```

- The output should look like this:
  ```
  default via 10.10.0.1 `dev ensX` proto dhcp src 10.10.0.13 metric 100 
  ```

- Shutdown the network interface:
  ```bash
  sudo ip link set ensX down
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/stateful-failover.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/stateful-failover.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Another way to disconnect the node

- We can also use `iptables` to block all traffic exiting the node

  (except SSH traffic, so we can repair the node later if needed)

.lab[

- SSH to the node to disrupt:
  ```bash
  ssh `nodeX`
  ```

- Allow SSH traffic leaving the node, but block all other traffic:
  ```bash
  sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 22 -j ACCEPT
  sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 2 -j DROP
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/stateful-failover.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/stateful-failover.md)]
---

## Watch what's going on

- Let's look at the status of Nodes, Pods, and Events

.lab[

- In a first pane/tab/window, check Nodes and Pods:
  ```bash
  watch kubectl get nodes,pods -o wide
  ```

- In another pane/tab/window, check Events:
  ```bash
  kubectl get events --watch
  ```

]

---

## Node Ready ‚Üí NotReady

- After \~30 seconds, the control plane stops receiving heartbeats from the Node

- The Node is marked NotReady

- It is not *schedulable* anymore

  (the scheduler won't place new pods there, except some special cases)

- All Pods on that Node are also *not ready*

  (they get removed from service Endpoints)

- ... But nothing else happens for now

  (the control plane is waiting: maybe the Node will come back shortly?)

.debug[[k8s/stateful-failover.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/stateful-failover.md)]
---

## Pod eviction

- After \~5 minutes, the control plane will evict most Pods from the Node

- These Pods are now `Terminating`

- The Pods controlled by e.g. ReplicaSets are automatically moved

  (or rather: new Pods are created to replace them)

- But nothing happens to the Pods controlled by StatefulSets at this point

  (they remain `Terminating` forever)

- Why? ü§î

--

- This is to avoid *split brain scenarios*

.debug[[k8s/stateful-failover.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/stateful-failover.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Split brain üß†‚ö°Ô∏èüß†

- Imagine that we create a replacement pod `postgres-0` on another Node

- And 15 minutes later, the Node is reconnected and the original `postgres-0` comes back

- Which one is the "right" one?

- What if they have conflicting data?

üò±

- We *cannot* let that happen!

- Kubernetes won't do it

- ... Unless we tell it to

.debug[[k8s/stateful-failover.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/stateful-failover.md)]
---

## The Node is gone

- One thing we can do, is tell Kubernetes "the Node won't come back"

  (there are other methods; but this one is the simplest one here)

- This is done with a simple `kubectl delete node`

.lab[

- `kubectl delete` the Node that we disconnected

]

.debug[[k8s/stateful-failover.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/stateful-failover.md)]
---

## Pod rescheduling

- Kubernetes removes the Node

- After a brief period of time (\~1 minute) the "Terminating" Pods are removed

- A replacement Pod is created on another Node

- ... But it doens't start yet!

- Why? ü§î

.debug[[k8s/stateful-failover.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/stateful-failover.md)]
---

## Multiple attachment

- By default, a disk can only be attached to one Node at a time

  (sometimes it's a hardware or API limitation; sometimes enforced in software)

- In our Events, we should see `FailedAttachVolume` and `FailedMount` messages

- After \~5 more minutes, the disk will be force-detached from the old Node

- ... Which will allow attaching it to the new Node!

üéâ

- The Pod will then be able to start

- Failover is complete!

.debug[[k8s/stateful-failover.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/stateful-failover.md)]
---

## Check that our data is still available

- We are going to reconnect to the (new) pod and check

.lab[

- Get a shell on the pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl exec -ti postgres-0 -- su postgres
  ```

<!--
```wait postgres@postgres```
```keys PS1="\u@\h:\w\n\$ "```
```key ^J```
-->

- Check how many transactions are now in the `pgbench_history` table:
  ```bash
  psql demo -c "select count(*) from pgbench_history"
  ```

<!-- ```key ^D``` -->

]

If the 10-second test that we ran earlier gave e.g. 80 transactions per second,
and we failed the node after 30 seconds, we should have about 2400 row in that table.

.debug[[k8s/stateful-failover.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/stateful-failover.md)]
---

## Double-check that the pod has really moved

- Just to make sure the system is not bluffing!

.lab[

- Look at which node the pod is now running on
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod postgres-0 -o wide
  ```

Suggested containerization checklist:

.checklist[
- write a Dockerfile for one service in one app
- write Dockerfiles for the other (buildable) services
- write a Compose file for that whole app
- make sure that devs are empowered to run the app in containers
- set up automated builds of container images from the code repo
- set up a CI pipeline using these container images
- set up a CD pipeline (for staging/QA) using these images
]

And *then* it is time to look at orchestration!

## Options for our first production cluster

- Get a managed cluster from a major cloud provider (AKS, EKS, GKE...)

  (price: $, difficulty: medium)

- Hire someone to deploy it for us

  (price: $$, difficulty: easy)

- Do it ourselves

  (price: $-$$$, difficulty: hard)

.debug[[k8s/whatsnext.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/whatsnext.md)]
---

## One big cluster vs. multiple small ones

- Yes, it is possible to have prod+dev in a single cluster

  (and implement good isolation and security with RBAC, network policies...)

- But it is not a good idea to do that for our first deployment

- Start with a production cluster + at least a test cluster

- Implement and check RBAC and isolation on the test cluster

  (e.g. deploy multiple test versions side-by-side)

- Make sure that all our devs have usable dev clusters

  (whether it's a local minikube or a full-blown multi-node cluster)

.debug[[k8s/whatsnext.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/whatsnext.md)]
---

## Namespaces

- Namespaces let you run multiple identical stacks side by side

- Two namespaces (e.g. `blue` and `green`) can each have their own `redis` service

- Each of the two `redis` services has its own `ClusterIP`

- CoreDNS creates two entries, mapping to these two `ClusterIP` addresses:

  `redis.blue.svc.cluster.local` and `redis.green.svc.cluster.local`

- Pods in the `blue` namespace get a *search suffix* of `blue.svc.cluster.local`

- As a result, resolving `redis` from a pod in the `blue` namespace yields the "local" `redis`

.warning[This does not provide *isolation*! That would be the job of network policies.]

---

## Stateful services (databases etc.)

- As a first step, it is wiser to keep stateful services *outside* of the cluster

- Exposing them to pods can be done with multiple solutions:

  - `ExternalName` services
    <br/>
    (`redis.blue.svc.cluster.local` will be a `CNAME` record)

  - `ClusterIP` services with explicit `Endpoints`
    <br/>
    (instead of letting Kubernetes generate the endpoints from a selector)

  - Ambassador services
    <br/>
    (application-level proxies that can provide credentials injection and more)

.debug[[k8s/whatsnext.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/whatsnext.md)]
---

## Stateful services (second take)

- If we want to host stateful services on Kubernetes, we can use:

  - a storage provider

  - persistent volumes, persistent volume claims

  - stateful sets

- Good questions to ask:

  - what's the *operational cost* of running this service ourselves?

  - what do we gain by deploying this stateful service on Kubernetes?

- Relevant sections:
  [Volumes](kube-selfpaced.yml.html#toc-volumes)

## HTTP traffic handling

- *Services* are layer 4 constructs

- HTTP is a layer 7 protocol

- It is handled by *ingresses* (a different resource kind)

- *Ingresses* allow:

  - virtual host routing
  - session stickiness
  - URI mapping
  - and much more!

- [This section](kube-selfpaced.yml.html#toc-exposing-http-services-with-ingress-resources) shows how to expose multiple HTTP apps using [Tr√¶fik](https://docs.traefik.io/user-guide/kubernetes/)

.debug[[k8s/whatsnext.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/whatsnext.md)]
---

## Logging

- Logging is delegated to the container engine

- Logs are exposed through the API

- Logs are also accessible through local files (`/var/log/containers`)

- Log shipping to a central platform is usually done through these files

  (e.g. with an agent bind-mounting the log directory)

- [This section](kube-selfpaced.yml.html#toc-centralized-logging) shows how to do that with [Fluentd](https://docs.fluentd.org/v0.12/articles/kubernetes-fluentd) and the EFK stack

.debug[[k8s/whatsnext.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/whatsnext.md)]
---

## Metrics

- The kubelet embeds [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor), which exposes container metrics

  (cAdvisor might be separated in the future for more flexibility)

- It is a good idea to start with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)

  (even if you end up using something else)

- Starting from Kubernetes 1.8, we can use the [Metrics API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/core-metrics-pipeline/)

- [Heapster](https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster) was a popular add-on

  (but is being [deprecated](https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster/blob/master/docs/deprecation.md) starting with Kubernetes 1.11)

.debug[[k8s/whatsnext.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/whatsnext.md)]

## Managing the configuration of our applications

- Two constructs are particularly useful: secrets and config maps

- They allow to expose arbitrary information to our containers

- **Avoid** storing configuration in container images

  (There are some exceptions to that rule, but it's generally a Bad Idea)

- **Never** store sensitive information in container images

## Managing stack deployments

- Applications are made of many resources

  (Deployments, Services, and much more)

- We need to automate the creation / update / management of these resources

- There is no "absolute best" tool or method; it depends on:

  - the size and complexity of our stack(s)
  - how often we change it (i.e. add/remove components)
  - the size and skills of our team

.debug[[k8s/whatsnext.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/whatsnext.md)]
---

## A few tools to manage stacks

- Shell scripts invoking `kubectl`

- YAML resource manifests committed to a repo

- [Kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize)
  (YAML manifests + patches applied on top)

- [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm)
  (YAML manifests + templating engine)

- [Spinnaker](https://www.spinnaker.io/)
  (Netflix' CD platform)

- [Brigade](https://brigade.sh/)
  (event-driven scripting; no YAML)

## Cluster federation

--

![Star Trek Federation](images/startrek-federation.jpg)

--

Sorry Star Trek fans, this is not the federation you're looking for!

--

(If I add "Your cluster is in another federation" I might get a 3rd fandom wincing!)

.debug[[k8s/whatsnext.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/whatsnext.md)]
---

## Cluster federation

- Kubernetes master operation relies on etcd

- etcd uses the [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) protocol

- Raft recommends low latency between nodes

- What if our cluster spreads to multiple regions?

--

- Break it down in local clusters

- Regroup them in a *cluster federation*

- Synchronize resources across clusters

- Discover resources across clusters

# Last words

- Congratulations!

- We learned a lot about Kubernetes, its internals, its advanced concepts

--

- That was just the easy part

- The hard challenges will revolve around *culture* and *people*

--

- ... What does that mean?

.debug[[k8s/lastwords.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/lastwords.md)]

## Running an app involves many steps

- Write the app

- Tests, QA ...

- Ship *something* (more on that later)

- Provision resources (e.g. VMs, clusters)

- Deploy the *something* on the resources

- Manage, maintain, monitor the resources

- Manage, maintain, monitor the app

- And much more

.debug[[k8s/lastwords.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/lastwords.md)]
---

## Who does what?

- The old "devs vs ops" division has changed

- In some organizations, "ops" are now called "SRE" or "platform" teams

  (and they have very different sets of skills)

- Do you know which team is responsible for each item on the list on the previous page?

- Acknowledge that a lot of tasks are outsourced

  (e.g. if we add "buy/rack/provision machines" in that list)

.debug[[k8s/lastwords.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/lastwords.md)]
---

## What do we ship?

- Some organizations embrace "you build it, you run it"

- When "build" and "run" are owned by different teams, where's the line?

- What does the "build" team ship to the "run" team?

- Let's see a few options, and what they imply

.debug[[k8s/lastwords.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/lastwords.md)]
---

## Shipping code

- Team "build" ships code

  (hopefully in a repository, identified by a commit hash)

- Team "run" containerizes that code

‚úîÔ∏è no extra work for developers

‚ùå very little advantage of using containers

.debug[[k8s/lastwords.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/lastwords.md)]
---

## Shipping container images

- Team "build" ships container images

  (hopefully built automatically from a source repository)

- Team "run" uses theses images to create e.g. Kubernetes resources

‚úîÔ∏è universal artefact (support all languages uniformly)

‚úîÔ∏è easy to start a single component (good for monoliths)

‚ùå complex applications will require a lot of extra work

‚ùå adding/removing components in the stack also requires extra work

‚ùå complex applications will run very differently between dev and prod

.debug[[k8s/lastwords.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/lastwords.md)]
---

## Shipping Compose files

(Or another kind of dev-centric manifest)

- Team "build" ships a manifest that works on a single node

  (as well as images, or ways to build them)

- Team "run" adapts that manifest to work on a cluster

‚úîÔ∏è all teams can start the stack in a reliable, deterministic manner

‚ùå adding/removing components still requires *some* work (but less than before)

‚ùå there will be *some* differences between dev and prod

.debug[[k8s/lastwords.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/lastwords.md)]
---

## Shipping Kubernetes manifests

- Team "build" ships ready-to-run manifests

  (YAML, Helm charts, Kustomize ...)

- Team "run" adjusts some parameters and monitors the application

‚úîÔ∏è parity between dev and prod environments

‚úîÔ∏è "run" team can focus on SLAs, SLOs, and overall quality

‚ùå requires *a lot* of extra work (and new skills) from the "build" team

‚ùå Kubernetes is not a very convenient development platform (at least, not yet)

.debug[[k8s/lastwords.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/lastwords.md)]
---

## What's the right answer?

- It depends on our teams

  - existing skills (do they know how to do it?)

  - availability (do they have the time to do it?)

  - potential skills (can they learn to do it?)

- It depends on our culture

  - owning "run" often implies being on call

  - do we reward on-call duty without encouraging hero syndrome?

  - do we give people resources (time, money) to learn?

## Tools to develop on Kubernetes

*If we decide to make Kubernetes the primary development platform, here
are a few tools that can help us.*

- Docker Desktop

- Draft

- Minikube

- Skaffold

- Tilt

- ...

.debug[[k8s/lastwords.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/lastwords.md)]
---

## Where do we run?

- Managed vs. self-hosted

- Cloud vs. on-premises

- If cloud: public vs. private

- Which vendor/distribution to pick?

- Which versions/features to enable?

.debug[[k8s/lastwords.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/lastwords.md)]
---

## Developer experience

*These questions constitute a quick "smoke test" for our strategy:*

- How do we on-board a new developer?

- What do they need to install to get a dev stack?

- How does a code change make it from dev to prod?

- How does someone add a component to a stack?

.debug[[k8s/lastwords.md](https://github.com/pedrovelho/container.training.git/tree/main/docs/k8s/lastwords.md)]
---

## Some guidelines

- Start small

- Outsource what we don't know

- Start simple, and stay simple as long as possible

  (try to stay away from complex features that we don't need)

- Automate

  (regularly check that we can successfully redeploy by following scripts)

- Transfer knowledge

  (make sure everyone is on the same page/level)

- Iterate!
